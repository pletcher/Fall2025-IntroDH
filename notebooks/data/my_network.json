It is regarded as one of the artistic marvels of the Baroque age. The statue is housed in the Galleria Borghese in Rome, along with several other examples of the artist's most important early works. The sculpture depicts the climax of the story of Apollo and Daphne (Phoebus and Daphne), as written in Ovid's Metamorphoses, wherein the nymph Daphne escapes Apollo's advances by transforming into a laurel tree.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nDetail of the sculpture\nApollo and Daphne was the last of a number of important works commissioned by Cardinal Scipione Borghese from Gian Lorenzo Bernini that helped to define Baroque sculpture. Thereafter, Bernini served a succession of popes. Apollo and Daphne was commissioned after Borghese had given an important work of his patronage, Bernini's The Rape of Proserpina (1621–22), to Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi.[1] Through this generous gesture, Borghese hoped to ingratiate himself to the favored nephew of the new pope, Gregory XV.[2]\nMuch of the early work on Apollo and Daphne was done in 1622–23, but  Bernini's work on his sculpture of David (1623–24) interrupted its completion. Bernini finished Apollo and Daphne in 1625,[3] and it was moved to the Cardinal's Villa Borghese in September of that year.[4] Bernini did not execute the sculpture entirely by his own hand. As was the common practice at that time, he had help from his workshop. Giuliano Finelli, who was a very gifted sculptor, undertook the finer details that show Daphne's conversion from human to tree, such as the twigs and leafs springing from her hands, and her windswept hair.[5] Some art historians, however, discount the importance of Finelli's contribution, since he was merely realizing Bernini's creative vision.[6] Apollo and Daphne's enthusiastic reception began as soon as the work was unveiled.[3]\n\nDescription[edit]\nAfter a lengthy pursuit, Apollo thinks he has finally caught Daphne. He has a hand on what he thinks is her hip, but her flesh is already turning into the bark of a tree. Apollo's billowing drapes convey the speed with which he has given chase.[2]\nWhile the sculpture may be appreciated from multiple angles, it was designed with a front side and a back side. Bernini planned for it to be viewed slightly from the right, where the work would have been visible from the doorway where it was located.[7] Viewing the sculpture from this angle allowed the observer to see the reactions of Apollo and Daphne simultaneously, and thus to understand the narrative of the story in a single instant, without the need to move position.[8]\nWhen viewed from the left, neither face and little of Daphne's body is visible. Instead, we see a tangle of hair and we can readily see the structural braces that Bernini built into the sculpture: \"the carefully designed solid, interlinking forms that connect and support one another.\"[2] From the right side, however, many details seem to be \"impossibly light and fragile.\"[2] Ultimately, however, the sculpture was moved to the middle of the room, where it can be seen from all angles.[9]\nLike Bernini's 1622 sculpture The Rape of Proserpina, Apollo and Daphne has a cartouche with a moral aphorism by Pope Urban VIII. Attributing Christian moral value to a pagan subject was a way of justifying the statue's presence in the Borghese villa.  \n\nIconography[edit]\nMain article: Daphne\nWhen Phoebus (Apollo), fated by Cupid's love-exciting arrow, sees Daphne, the maiden daughter of Peneus, a river god, he is filled with wonder at her beauty and consumed by desire. But Daphne has been fated by Cupid's love-repelling arrow and denies the love of men. As the Nymph flees he relentlessly chases her—boasting, pleading, and promising everything. When her strength is finally spent she prays to her father Peneus:\n\n\"Destroy the beauty that has injured me, or change the body that destroys my life.\" \nBefore her prayer was ended, torpor seized on all her body, and a thin bark closed around her gentle bosom, and her hair became as moving leaves; her arms were changed to waving branches, and her active feet as clinging roots were fastened to the ground—her face was hidden with encircling leaves.[10]\nYet Phoebus lost none of his passion for Daphne:\n\n Even like this Phoebus loved her and, placing his hand against the trunk, he felt her heart still quivering under the new bark. He clasped the branches as if they were parts of human arms, and kissed the wood. But even the wood shrank from his kisses, and the god said:\n\"Since you cannot be my bride, you must be my tree! Laurel, with you my hair will be wreathed, with you my lyre, with you my quiver. You will go with the Roman generals when joyful voices acclaim their triumph, and the Capitol witnesses their long processions. You will stand outside Augustus's doorposts, a faithful guardian, and keep watch over the crown of oak between them. And just as my head with its uncropped hair is always young, so you also will wear the beauty of undying leaves.\"\n\nPaean had done: the laurel bowed her newly made branches, and seemed to shake her leafy crown, like a head giving consent.[11]\nCritical reception[edit]\nIt is difficult to overstate the importance and the immediate effect of the statues that Bernini made for Scipione Borghese: \"Bernini proved that he could make images that dazzled visually, told a story with high drama, and aroused powerful sentiments. These acclaimed statues had qualities the church was seeking, and they helped propel Bernini on his path to become the chief visual propagandist of the Counter-Reformation, and the single most important creator of Baroque Rome.\"[2] Since his work was so synonymous with the Baroque, Bernini's critical fortunes often rose and fell with those of the Baroque in general.  \nAppreciation for Apollo and Daphne continued, sometimes surviving the decline of Bernini's reputation after his death.  A French traveler in 1839 commented that the group is \"astonishing both for mechanism of art and elaborateness, is full of charm in the ensemble and the details.\"[12] One 19th-century literary journal considered it the only Bernini work worthy of lasting praise.[13]  Others were less positive. An English travel writer in 1829 noted Bernini's technical skill but added that the sculpture \"bears all the want of judgment, taste, and knowledge of that age\", going on to criticize the appearance of Apollo for being too like a shepherd and not enough like a god.[14]\nMore recent historians have been much more positive. Robert Torsten Petersson calls it \"an extraordinary masterpiece ... suffused with an energy that works out of the tips of the laurel leaves and Apollo's hand and drapery.\"[15] C.D. Dickerson III says The Rape of Proserpina, David, and Apollo and Daphne  are “widely considered the high points of Bernini’s entire career — and even of all seventeenth century sculpture.”[16]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of works by Gian Lorenzo Bernini\nReferences[edit]\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Hibbard 1990, p. 38.\n\n^ a b c d e Cordova, Ruben C.

        "content": "ISO standard unique string identifier for a digital object\nFor the use of digital object identifiers on Wikipedia, see Wikipedia:Digital Object Identifier.\n\n\nDigital object identifierFull nameDigital Object IdentifierAcronymDOIOrganisationInternational DOI FoundationIntroducedOctober 1997; 28 years ago (1997-10)[1]Example10.1000/182Websitewww.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/ \nA digital object identifier (DOI) is a persistent identifier or handle used to uniquely identify various objects, standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).[2] DOIs are an implementation of the Handle System;[3][4] they also fit within the URI system (Uniform Resource Identifier). They are widely used to identify academic, professional, and government information, such as journal articles, research reports, data sets, and official publications.\nA DOI aims to resolve to its target, the information object to which the DOI refers. This is achieved by binding the DOI to metadata about the object, such as a URL where the object is located. Thus, by being actionable and interoperable, a DOI differs from ISBNs or ISRCs which are identifiers only. The DOI system uses the indecs Content Model to represent metadata.\nThe DOI for a document remains fixed over the lifetime of the document, whereas its location and other metadata may change. Referring to an online document by its DOI should provide a more stable link than directly using its URL. But if its URL changes, the publisher must update the metadata for the DOI to maintain the link to the URL.[5][6][7] It is the publisher's responsibility to update the DOI database. If they fail to do so, the DOI resolves to a dead link, leaving the DOI useless.[8]\nThe developer and administrator of the DOI system is the International DOI Foundation (IDF), which introduced it in 2000.[9] Organizations that meet the contractual obligations of the DOI system and are willing to pay to become a member of the system can assign DOIs.[10] The DOI system is implemented through a federation of registration agencies coordinated by the IDF.[11] The cumulative number of DOIs has increased exponentially over time, from 50 million registrations in 2011 to 391 million in 2025.[12] The rate of registering organizations (\"members\") has also increased over time from 4,000 in 2011 to 9,500 in 2013, but the federated nature of the system means it is not immediately clear how many members there are in total today.[13] Fake registries have even appeared.[14]\n\n\n Nomenclature and syntax[edit]\nA DOI is a type of Handle System handle, which takes the form of a character string divided into two parts, a prefix and a suffix, separated by a slash.\n\nprefix/suffix\n\nThe prefix identifies the registrant of the identifier and the suffix is chosen by the registrant and identifies the specific object associated with that DOI. Most legal Unicode characters are allowed in these strings, which are interpreted in a case-insensitive manner. The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN is a number greater than or equal to 1000, whose limit depends only on the total number of registrants.[15][16] The prefix may be further subdivided with periods, like 10.NNNN.N.[17]\nFor example, in the DOI name 10.1000/182, the prefix is 10.1000 and the suffix is 182. The \"10\" part of the prefix distinguishes the handle as part of the DOI namespace, as opposed to some other Handle System namespace,[A] and the characters 1000 in the prefix identify the registrant; in this case the registrant is the International DOI Foundation itself. 182 is the suffix, or item ID, identifying a single object (in this case, the latest version of the DOI Handbook).\nDOI names can identify creative works (such as texts, images, audio or video items, and software) in both electronic and physical forms, performances, and abstract works[18] such as licenses, parties to a transaction, etc.\nThe names can refer to objects at varying levels of detail: thus DOI names can identify a journal, an individual issue of a journal, an individual article in the journal, or a single table in that article. The choice of level of detail is left to the assigner, but in the DOI system it must be declared as part of the metadata that is associated with a DOI name, using a data dictionary based on the indecs Content Model.\n\nDisplay[edit]\nThe official DOI Handbook explicitly states that DOIs should be displayed on screens and in print in the format doi:10.1000/182.[19]\nContrary to the DOI Handbook, Crossref, a major DOI registration agency, recommends displaying a URL (for example, https://doi.org/10.1000/182) instead of the officially specified format.[20][21]. The DOI Foundation guarantees these URLs to be persistent[22] ie. such URLs are PURLs — providing the location of a name resolver which will redirect HTTP requests to the correct online location of the linked item.[10][23]\nThe Crossref recommendation is primarily based on the assumption that the DOI is being displayed without being hyperlinked to its appropriate URL—the argument being that without the hyperlink it is not as easy to copy-and-paste the full URL to actually bring up the page for the DOI, thus the entire URL should be displayed, allowing people viewing the page containing the DOI to copy-and-paste the URL, by hand, into a new window/tab in their browser in order to go to the appropriate page for the document the DOI represents.[24]\n\nContent[edit]\nMajor content of the DOI system currently includes:\n\nScholarly materials (journal articles, books, ebooks, etc.) through Crossref, a consortium of around 3,000 publishers; Airiti, a leading provider of Chinese and Taiwanese electronic academic journals; and the Japan Link Center (JaLC)[25] an organization providing link management and DOI assignment for electronic academic journals in Japanese.\nResearch datasets through DataCite, a consortium of leading research libraries, technical information providers, and scientific data centers;\nEuropean Union official publications through the EU publications office;\nThe Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure project at Tsinghua University and the Institute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (ISTIC), two initiatives sponsored by the Chinese government.\nPermanent global identifiers for both commercial and non-commercial audio/visual content titles, edits, and manifestations through the Entertainment ID Registry, commonly known as EIDR.\nIn the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's publication service OECD iLibrary, each table or graph in an OECD publication is shown with a DOI name that leads to an Excel file of data underlying the tables and graphs. Further development of such services is planned.[26]\nOther registries include Crossref and the multilingual European DOI Registration Agency (mEDRA).[27] Since 2015, RFCs can be referenced as doi:10.17487/rfc....[28]\n\nFeatures and benefits[edit]\nThe IDF designed the DOI system to provide persistent identification. Each DOI name permanently and clearly identifies the object it belongs to (although when the publisher of a journal changes, sometimes all the DOIs will be changed, with the old DOIs no longer working). It also associates metadata with objects, allowing it to provide users with relevant pieces of information about the objects and their relationships. Included as part of this metadata are network actions that allow DOI names to be resolved to web locations where the objects they describe can be found. To achieve its goals, the DOI system combines the Handle System and the indecs Content Model with a social infrastructure.\nThe Handle System ensures that the DOI name for an object is not based on any changeable attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the URI specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it in the same way as with any other web service; it is built on open architectures, incorporates trust mechanisms, and is engineered to operate reliably and flexibly so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system.[29] DOI name-resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request.[30] However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents, that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.[31]\nThe indecs Content Model as used within the DOI system associates metadata with objects. A small kernel of common metadata is shared by all DOI names and can be optionally extended with other relevant data, which may be public or restricted. Registrants may update the metadata for their DOI names at any time, such as when publication information changes or when an object moves to a different URL.\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF) oversees the integration of these technologies and operation of the system through a technical and social infrastructure. The social infrastructure of a federation of independent registration agencies offering DOI services was modelled on existing successful federated deployments of identifiers such as GS1 and ISBN.\n\nComparison with other identifier schemes[edit]\nA DOI name differs from commonly used Internet pointers to material, such as the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), in that it identifies an object itself as a first-class entity, rather than the specific place where the object is located at a certain time. It implements the Uniform Resource Identifier (Uniform Resource Name) concept and adds to it a data model and social infrastructure.[32]\nA DOI name also differs from standard identifier registries such as the ISBN, ISRC, etc. The purpose of an identifier registry is to manage a given collection of identifiers, whereas the primary purpose of the DOI system is to make a collection of identifiers actionable and interoperable, where that collection can include identifiers from many other controlled collections.[33]\nThe DOI system offers persistent, semantically interoperable resolution to related current data and is best suited to material that will be used in services outside the direct control of the issuing assigner (e.g., public citation or managing content of value). It uses a managed registry (providing both social and technical infrastructure). It does not assume any specific business model for the provision of identifiers or services and enables other existing services to link to it in defined ways. Several approaches for making identifiers persistent have been proposed.\nThe comparison of persistent identifier approaches is difficult because they are not all doing the same thing. Imprecisely referring to a set of schemes as \"identifiers\" does not mean that they can be compared easily. Other \"identifier systems\" may be enabling technologies with low barriers to entry, providing an easy to use labeling mechanism that allows anyone to set up a new instance (examples include Persistent Uniform Resource Locator (PURL), URLs, Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), etc.), but may lack some of the functionality of a registry-controlled scheme and will usually lack accompanying metadata in a controlled scheme.\nThe DOI system does not have this approach and should not be compared directly to such identifier schemes. Various applications using such enabling technologies with added features have been devised that meet some of the features offered by the DOI system for specific sectors (e.g., ARK).\nA DOI name does not depend on the object's location and, in this way, is similar to a Uniform Resource Name (URN) or PURL but differs from an ordinary URL. URLs are often used as substitute identifiers for documents on the Internet although the same document at two different locations has two URLs. By contrast, persistent identifiers such as DOI names identify objects as first class entities: two instances of the same object would have the same DOI name. In May, 2024, an Internet Draft was introduced to register the \"doi\" scheme,[34]. Many experts were not aware of this draft,[35] and the latest draft has currently expired.\n\nResolution[edit]\nTo resolve a DOI name, it may be input to a DOI resolver, such as one at the official website https://doi.org/.\nDOI name resolution is provided through the Handle System, which is an infrastructure developed and operated by CNRI (Corporation for National Research Initiatives), and is freely available to any user encountering a DOI name. Resolution redirects the user from a DOI name to one or more pieces of typed data: URLs representing instances of the object, services such as e-mail, or one or more items of metadata. To the Handle System, a DOI name is a handle, and so has a set of values assigned to it and may be thought of as a record that consists of a group of fields. Each handle value must have a data type specified in its <type> field, which defines the syntax and semantics of its data. While a DOI persistently and uniquely identifies the object to which it is assigned, DOI resolution may not be persistent, due to technical and administrative issues.\nAnother approach, which avoids typing or copying and pasting into a resolver is to include the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as https://doi.org/ (preferred)[36] or http://dx.doi.org/, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI 10.1000/182 can be included in a reference or hyperlink as https://doi.org/10.1000/182. This approach allows users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how Crossref recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.\nAn interesting consequence of the fact that DOIs depend entirely on CNRI's Handle System infrastructure (whereby CNRI operates the global root servers and wrote the protocol) is that the proxy services DOI.org/<#> and hdl.handle.net/<#> are interoperable. For example, the following URIs resolve to the same publication:\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/S0021-9258(19)52451-6\nhttps://hdl.handle.net/10.1016/S0021-9258(19)52451-6\nThere are other DOI resolvers and HTTP Proxies apart from NCRI's Handle System. At the beginning of the year 2016, a new class of alternative DOI resolvers was started by http://doai.io/ (now discontinued [37]). This service was unusual in that it tried to find a non-paywalled (often author archived) version of a title and redirected the user to that instead of the publisher's version.[38] Since then, other open-access favoring DOI resolvers have been created, notably https://oadoi.org/ in October 2016[39] (rebranded in 2017 as https://unpaywall.org/). While traditional DOI resolvers solely rely on the Handle System, alternative DOI resolvers first consult multiple Open Access resources such as institutional libraries with the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), or indexing services  based in OAI-PMH, such as BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine).[37][39]\nAn alternative to HTTP proxies is to use one of a number of add-ons and plug-ins for browsers, thereby avoiding the conversion of the DOIs to URLs,[40] which depend on domain names and may be subject to change, while still allowing the DOI to be treated as a normal hyperlink. A disadvantage of this approach for publishers is that, at least at present, most users will be encountering the DOIs in a browser, mail reader, or other software which does not have one of these plug-ins installed.\n\nIDF organizational structure[edit]\nInternational DOI FoundationLogo of the foundationCompany type501(c)(6) organizationFoundedOctober 10, 1997; 28 years ago (1997-10-10)\nThe International DOI Foundation (IDF), a non-profit organization created in 1997, is the governance body of the DOI system.[41] It safeguards all intellectual property rights relating to the DOI system, manages common operational features, and supports the development and promotion of the DOI system. The IDF ensures that any improvements made to the DOI system (including creation, maintenance, registration, resolution and policymaking of DOI names) are available to any DOI registrant. It also prevents third parties from imposing additional licensing requirements beyond those of the IDF on users of the DOI system.\nThe IDF is controlled by a Board elected by the members of the Foundation, with an appointed Managing Agent who is responsible for co-ordinating and planning its activities. Membership is open to all organizations with an interest in electronic publishing and related enabling technologies. The IDF holds annual open meetings on the topics of DOI and related issues.\nRegistration agencies, appointed by the IDF, provide services to DOI registrants: they allocate DOI prefixes, register DOI names, and provide the necessary infrastructure to allow registrants to declare and maintain metadata and state data. Registration agencies are also expected to actively promote the widespread adoption of the DOI system, to cooperate with the IDF in the development of the DOI system as a whole, and to provide services on behalf of their specific user community. A list of current RAs is maintained by the International DOI Foundation. The IDF is recognized as one of the federated registrars for the Handle System by the DONA Foundation (of which the IDF is a board member), and is responsible for assigning Handle System prefixes under the top-level 10 prefix.[42]\nRegistration agencies generally charge a fee to assign a new DOI name; parts of these fees are used to support the IDF. The DOI system overall, through the IDF, operates on a not-for-profit cost recovery basis.\n\nStandardization[edit]\nThe DOI system is an international standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization in its technical committee on identification and description, TC46/SC9.[43] The Draft International Standard ISO/DIS 26324, Information and documentation – Digital Object Identifier System met the ISO requirements for approval. The relevant ISO Working Group later submitted an edited version to ISO for distribution as an FDIS (Final Draft International Standard) ballot,[44] which was approved by 100% of those voting in a ballot closing on 15 November 2010.[45] The final standard was published on 23 April 2012.[2]\nDOI is a registered URI under the info URI scheme specified by IETF RFC 4452.[46] info:doi/ is the infoURI Namespace of Digital Object Identifiers.[47]\nThe DOI syntax is a NISO standard, first standardized in 2000, ANSI/NISO Z39.84-2005 Syntax for the Digital Object Identifier.[48]\nThe maintainers of the DOI system have registered a DOI namespace for URNs.[49]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\narXiv\nBibcode\nDataCite\nDigital identity\nMetadata standard\nObject identifier\nORCID\nPermalink\nPMID\nPublisher Item Identifier (PII)\nScientific literature\nUniversally unique identifier (UUID)\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Other registries are identified by other strings at the start of the prefix.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Morgan, Cliff (n.d.)

For example, an e-book, a paperback and a hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN, but an unchanged reprint of the hardcover edition keeps the same ISBN. The ISBN is ten digits long if assigned before 2007, and thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007.[c] The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-specific and varies between countries, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.\nThe first version of the ISBN identification format was devised in 1967, based upon the 9-digit Standard Book Numbering (SBN) created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (any 9-digit SBN can be converted to a 10-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero).\nPrivately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN Agency sometimes assigns ISBNs to such books on its own initiative.[4]\nA separate identifier code of a similar kind, the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers. The International Standard Music Number (ISMN) covers musical scores.\n\n\n History\nThe Standard Book Number (SBN) is a commercial system using nine-digit code numbers to identify books. In 1965, British bookseller and stationers WHSmith announced plans to implement a standard numbering system for its books.[1] They hired consultants to work on their behalf, and the system was devised by Gordon Foster, emeritus professor of statistics at Trinity College Dublin.[5] The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Technical Committee on Documentation sought to adapt the British SBN for international use. The ISBN identification format was conceived in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker[6][7] (regarded as the \"Father of the ISBN\")[8] and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay[6] (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency R. R. Bowker).[8][9][10]\nThe 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the ISO and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108.[1][6] The United Kingdom continued to use the nine-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 TC 46/SC 9. The ISO on-line facility only refers back to 1978.[11]\n\nTotal number of ISBN registrations. 2020.\nAn SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit \"0\". For example, the second edition of Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns, published by Hodder in 1965, has \"SBN 340 01381 8\", where \"340\" indicates the publisher, \"01381\" is the serial number assigned by the publisher, and \"8\" is the check digit. By prefixing a zero, this can be converted to ISBN 0-340-01381-8; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated. Some publishers, such as Ballantine Books, would sometimes use 12-digit SBNs where the last three digits indicated the price of the book;[12] for example, Woodstock Handmade Houses had a 12-digit Standard Book Number of 345-24223-8-595 (valid SBN: 345-24223-8, ISBN: 0-345-24223-8),[13] and it cost US$5.95.[14]\nSince 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained thirteen digits, a format that is compatible with \"Bookland\" European Article Numbers, which have 13 digits.[3] Since 2016, ISBNs have also been used to identify mobile games by China's Administration of Press and Publication.[15]\nThe United States, with 3.9 million registered ISBNs in 2020, was by far the biggest user of the ISBN identifier in 2020, followed by the Republic of Korea (329,582), Germany (284,000), China (263,066), the UK (188,553) and Indonesia (144,793). Lifetime ISBNs registered in the United States are over 39 million as of 2020.[16]\n\nOverview\nA separate ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a publication. For example, an ebook, audiobook, paperback, and hardcover edition of the same book must each have a different ISBN assigned to it.[17]: 12  The ISBN of an electronic publication is often colloquially called \"eISBN\",[18][19] however no such notation is present in the documentation. Whether a publication is electronic or print cannot be inferred from the ISBN only. The ISBN is thirteen digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and ten digits long if assigned before 2007.[c][3] An International Standard Book Number consists of four parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or five parts (for a 13-digit ISBN).\nSection 5 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual[17]: 11  describes the structure of the 13-digit ISBN, as follows:\n\nThe parts of a 10-digit ISBN and the corresponding EAN‑13 and barcode. Note the different check digits in each. The part of the EAN‑13 labeled \"EAN\" is the Bookland country code.\nfor a 13-digit ISBN, a prefix element – a GS1 prefix: so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1,\nthe registration group element (language-sharing country group, individual country or territory),[d]\nthe registrant element,\nthe publication element, and\na checksum character or check digit.\nA 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (prefix element, registration group, registrant, publication and check digit), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with hyphens or spaces. Separating the parts (registration group, registrant, publication and check digit) of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.[e] Online tools such the ISBN Converter provided by the Library of Congress and ISBNBarcode.org can assist with hyphenation and generate standard barcodes.[21][22]\n\nIssuing process \nISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from the government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.[23]\nA full directory of ISBN agencies is available on the International ISBN Agency website.[24] A list for a few countries is given below:\n\nAustralia – Thorpe-Bowker[25][26]\nBrazil – The National Library of Brazil;[27] (Up to 28 February 2020)[28]\nBrazil – Câmara Brasileira do Livro[29] (From 1 March 2020)[28]\nCanada – English Library and Archives Canada, a government agency; French Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec;\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) secretariat[30][31] maintains a shared ISBN of '976' for several member states of the Caribbean region.\nColombia – Cámara Colombiana del Libro, an NGO\nHong Kong – Books Registration Office (BRO), under the Hong Kong Public Libraries[32]\nIceland – Landsbókasafn (National and University Library of Iceland)\nIndia – The Raja Rammohun Roy National Agency for ISBN (Book Promotion and Copyright Division), under Department of Higher Education, a constituent of the Ministry of Human Resource Development[33]\nIsrael – The Israel Center for Libraries[34]\nItaly – EDISER srl, owned by Associazione Italiana Editori (Italian Publishers Association)[35][36]\nKenya – National Library of Kenya\nLatvia - Latvian ISBN Agency\nLebanon – Lebanese ISBN Agency\nMaldives – The National Bureau of Classification (NBC)\nMalta – The National Book Council (Maltese: Il-Kunsill Nazzjonali tal-Ktieb)[37][38][39]\nMorocco – The National Library of Morocco\nNew Zealand – The National Library of New Zealand[40]\nNigeria – National Library of Nigeria\nPakistan – National Library of Pakistan\nPhilippines – National Library of the Philippines[41]\nSouth Africa – National Library of South Africa\nSpain – Spanish ISBN Agency – Agencia del ISBN\nTurkey – General Directorate of Libraries and Publications, a branch of the Ministry of Culture[42]\nUnited Kingdom and Republic of Ireland – Nielsen Book Services Ltd, part of NIQ[43]\nUnited States – R. R. Bowker[6][44]\nRegistration group element\n\n\nThe ISBN registration group element is a 1-to-5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979),[17]: 11  and can be separated between hyphens, such as \"978-1-...\". Registration groups have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element - many inherited from the 10 digit ISBN.[45] The single-digit registration groups within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. Example 5-digit registration groups are 99936 and 99980, for Bhutan. The allocated registration groups are: 0–5, 600–631, 65, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9910–9989, and 99901–99993.[46] Books published in rare languages typically have longer group elements.[47]\nWithin the 979 prefix element, the registration group 0 is reserved for compatibility with International Standard Music Numbers (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN.[48] The registration groups within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 8 for the United States of America, 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.[49]\nThe original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.\n\nRegistrant element\nThe national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element (cf. Category:ISBN agencies) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not legally required to assign an ISBN, although most large bookstores only handle publications that have ISBNs assigned to them.[50][51][52]\nThe International ISBN Agency maintains the details of over one million ISBN prefixes and publishers in the Global Register of Publishers.[53] This database is freely searchable over the internet.\nPublishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.\nBy using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.[54] Here are some sample ISBN-10 codes, illustrating block length variations.\n\n\n\nISBN\nCountry or area\nPublisher\n\n\n99921-58-10-7\nQatar\nNCCAH, Doha\n\n\n9971-5-0210-0\nSingapore\nWorld Scientific\n\n\n960-425-059-0\nGreece\nSigma Publications\n\n\n80-902734-1-6\nCzech Republic; Slovakia\nTaita Publishers\n\n\n85-359-0277-5\nBrazil\nCompanhia das Letras\n\n\n1-84356-028-3\nEnglish-speaking area\nSimon Wallenberg Press\n\n\n0-684-84328-5\nEnglish-speaking area\nScribner\n\n\n0-8044-2957-X\nEnglish-speaking area\nFrederick Ungar\n\n\n0-85131-041-9\nEnglish-speaking area\nJ.

It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the 10-digit ISBN is an extension of that for SBNs, so the two systems are compatible; an SBN prefixed with a zero (the 10-digit ISBN) will give the same check digit as the SBN without the zero. The check digit is base eleven, and can be an integer between 0 and 9, or an 'X'. The system for 13-digit ISBNs is not compatible with SBNs and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, so does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the 13-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain the letter 'X'.\n\nISBN-10 check digits\nAccording to the 2001 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual,[55] the ISBN-10 check digit (which is the last digit of the 10-digit ISBN) must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol 'X' is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of 11. That is, if xi is the ith digit (numbering from left to right), then x10 must be chosen such that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n∑\n\ni\n=\n1\n\n\n10\n\n\n(\n11\n−\ni\n)\n\nx\n\ni\n\n\n≡\n0\n\n\n(\nmod\n\n11\n)\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle \\sum _{i=1}^{10}(11-i)x_{i}\\equiv 0{\\pmod {11}}.}\n\n\nFor example, for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-2:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n=\n(\n0\n×\n10\n)\n+\n(\n3\n×\n9\n)\n+\n(\n0\n×\n8\n)\n+\n(\n6\n×\n7\n)\n+\n(\n4\n×\n6\n)\n+\n(\n0\n×\n5\n)\n+\n(\n6\n×\n4\n)\n+\n(\n1\n×\n3\n)\n+\n(\n5\n×\n2\n)\n+\n(\n2\n×\n1\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n0\n+\n27\n+\n0\n+\n42\n+\n24\n+\n0\n+\n24\n+\n3\n+\n10\n+\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n132\n=\n12\n×\n11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}s&=(0\\times 10)+(3\\times 9)+(0\\times 8)+(6\\times 7)+(4\\times 6)+(0\\times 5)+(6\\times 4)+(1\\times 3)+(5\\times 2)+(2\\times 1)\\\\&=0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10+2\\\\&=132=12\\times 11.\\end{aligned}}}\n\n\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, this is rendered\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n10\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n+\n9\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n8\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n+\n7\n\nx\n\n4\n\n\n+\n6\n\nx\n\n5\n\n\n+\n5\n\nx\n\n6\n\n\n+\n4\n\nx\n\n7\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n8\n\n\n+\n2\n\nx\n\n9\n\n\n+\n\nx\n\n10\n\n\n)\n≡\n0\n\n\n(\nmod\n\n11\n)\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (10x_{1}+9x_{2}+8x_{3}+7x_{4}+6x_{5}+5x_{6}+4x_{7}+3x_{8}+2x_{9}+x_{10})\\equiv 0{\\pmod {11}}.}\n\n\nIt is also true for ISBN 10s that the sum of all ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ascending order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11.

It can be proven mathematically that all pairs of valid ISBN 10s differ in at least two digits. It can also be proven that there are no pairs of valid ISBN 10s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits (these proofs are true because the ISBN is less than eleven digits long and because 11 is a prime number). The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e., if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN—the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error were to occur in the publishing house and remain undetected, the book would be issued with an invalid ISBN.[56]\nIn contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).\n\nISBN-10 check digit calculation\nEach of the first nine digits of the 10-digit ISBN—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.\nFor example, the check digit for an ISBN-10 of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n=\n(\n0\n×\n10\n)\n+\n(\n3\n×\n9\n)\n+\n(\n0\n×\n8\n)\n+\n(\n6\n×\n7\n)\n+\n(\n4\n×\n6\n)\n+\n(\n0\n×\n5\n)\n+\n(\n6\n×\n4\n)\n+\n(\n1\n×\n3\n)\n+\n(\n5\n×\n2\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n130.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}s&=(0\\times 10)+(3\\times 9)+(0\\times 8)+(6\\times 7)+(4\\times 6)+(0\\times 5)+(6\\times 4)+(1\\times 3)+(5\\times 2)\\\\&=130.\\end{aligned}}}\n\n\nAdding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (because 132 = 12×11)—this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is ISBN 0-306-40615-2. If the value of \n\n\n\n\nx\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{10}}\n\n required to satisfy this condition is 10, then an 'X' should be used.\nAlternatively, modular arithmetic is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The remainder of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation, the calculation could result in a check digit value of 11 − 0 = 11, which is invalid. (Strictly speaking, the first \"modulo 11\" is not needed, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)\nFor example, the check digit for the ISBN of 0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns\n\n\n\n=\n(\n11\n−\n(\n(\n(\n0\n×\n10\n)\n+\n(\n3\n×\n9\n)\n+\n(\n0\n×\n8\n)\n+\n(\n6\n×\n7\n)\n+\n(\n4\n×\n6\n)\n+\n(\n0\n×\n5\n)\n+\n(\n6\n×\n4\n)\n+\n(\n1\n×\n3\n)\n+\n(\n5\n×\n2\n)\n)\n\n\nmod\n\n\n\n\n11\n)\n)\n\n\nmod\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n(\n11\n−\n(\n(\n0\n+\n27\n+\n0\n+\n42\n+\n24\n+\n0\n+\n24\n+\n3\n+\n10\n)\n\n\nmod\n\n\n\n\n11\n)\n)\n\n\nmod\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n(\n11\n−\n(\n(\n130\n)\n\n\nmod\n\n\n\n\n11\n)\n)\n\n\nmod\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n(\n11\n−\n(\n9\n)\n)\n\n\nmod\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n2\n\n\nmod\n\n\n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}s&=(11-(((0\\times 10)+(3\\times 9)+(0\\times 8)+(6\\times 7)+(4\\times 6)+(0\\times 5)+(6\\times 4)+(1\\times 3)+(5\\times 2))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=(11-((0+27+0+42+24+0+24+3+10)\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=(11-((130)\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=(11-(9))\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=2\\,{\\bmod {\\,}}11\\\\&=2\\end{aligned}}}\n\n\nThus the check digit is 2.\nIt is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding t into s computes the necessary multiples:\n\n// Returns ISBN error syndrome, zero for a valid ISBN, non-zero for an invalid one.\n// digits[i] must be between 0 and 10.\nint CheckISBN(int const digits[10]) {\n  int i, s = 0, t = 0;\n\n  for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {\n    t += digits[i];\n    s += t;\n  }\n  return s % 11;\n}\n\nThe modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case s could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid ISBN 99999-999-9-X), or s and t could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.\n\nISBN-13 check digit calculation\nAppendix 1 of the International ISBN Agency's official user manual[17]: 33  describes how the 13-digit ISBN check digit is calculated. The ISBN-13 check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of 10. As ISBN-13 is a subset of EAN-13, the algorithm for calculating the check digit is exactly the same for both.\nFormally, using modular arithmetic, this is rendered:\n\n\n\n\n\n(\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n4\n\n\n+\n\nx\n\n5\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n6\n\n\n+\n\nx\n\n7\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n8\n\n\n+\n\nx\n\n9\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n10\n\n\n+\n\nx\n\n11\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n12\n\n\n+\n\nx\n\n13\n\n\n)\n≡\n0\n\n\n(\nmod\n\n10\n)\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle (x_{1}+3x_{2}+x_{3}+3x_{4}+x_{5}+3x_{6}+x_{7}+3x_{8}+x_{9}+3x_{10}+x_{11}+3x_{12}+x_{13})\\equiv 0{\\pmod {10}}.}\n\n\nThe calculation of an ISBN-13 check digit begins with the first twelve digits of the 13-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed modulo 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero replaces a ten, so, in all cases, a single check digit results.\nFor example, the ISBN-13 check digit of 978-0-306-40615-? is calculated as follows:\n\ns = 9×1 + 7×3 + 8×1 + 0×3 + 3×1 + 0×3 + 6×1 + 4×3 + 0×1 + 6×3 + 1×1 + 5×3\n  =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15\n  = 93\n93 / 10 = 9 remainder 3\n10 –  3 = 7\n\nThus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7.\nIn general, the ISBN check digit is calculated as follows.\nLet\n\n\n\n\n\nr\n=\n10\n−\n\n\n(\n\n\n\n\n(\n\n\n\nx\n\n1\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n2\n\n\n+\n\nx\n\n3\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n4\n\n\n+\n⋯\n+\n\nx\n\n11\n\n\n+\n3\n\nx\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n)\n\n\n\nmod\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n)\n\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle r=10-{\\big (}{\\big (}x_{1}+3x_{2}+x_{3}+3x_{4}+\\cdots +x_{11}+3x_{12}{\\big )}{\\bmod {1}}0{\\big )}.}\n\n\nThen\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n\n13\n\n\n=\n\n\n{\n\n\n\nr\n,\n\n\nr\n<\n10\n,\n\n\n\n\n0\n,\n\n\nr\n=\n10.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle x_{13}={\\begin{cases}r,&r<10,\\\\0,&r=10.\\end{cases}}}\n\n\nThis check system—similar to the UPC check digit formula—does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3 × 6 + 1 × 1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3 × 1 + 1 × 6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The ISBN-10 formula uses the prime modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0–9 to express the check digit.\nAdditionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).\n\nISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion\nA 10-digit ISBN is converted to a 13-digit ISBN by prepending \"978\" to the  ISBN-10 and recalculating the final checksum digit using the ISBN-13 algorithm. The reverse process can also be performed, but not for numbers commencing with a prefix other than 978, which have no 10-digit equivalent.\n\nErrors in usage\nPublishers and libraries have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers.[57] For example, ISBN 0-590-76484-5 is shared by two books—Ninja gaiden: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo (1990) and Wacky laws (1997), both published by Scholastic.\nMost libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The Library of Congress catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase \"Cancelled ISBN\".[58] The International Union Library Catalog (WorldCat OCLC—Online Computer Library Center system) often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.[59]\n\nEAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading\nThe barcodes on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market paperback book's front cover) are EAN-13; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an EAN-5 for the currency and the recommended retail price.[60] For 10-digit ISBNs, the number \"978\", the Bookland \"country code\", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN-13 formula (modulo 10, 1× and 3× weighting on alternating digits).\nPartly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) decided to migrate to a 13-digit ISBN (ISBN-13). The process began on 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude on 1 January 2007.[61] As of 2011[update], all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the Musicland code for musical scores with an ISMN. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an \"M\" letter; the bar code represents the \"M\" as a zero, and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now thirteen digits commencing 979-0, while 979-1 to 979-9 are used for ISBN, 979-8- used for USA.\nPublisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the 10-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the 13-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.[62]\nBarcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the ISBN-13 barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to information technology systems. Hence, many booksellers (e.g., Barnes & Noble) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the UPC barcode system to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the ISBN in North America.\n\nSee also\nASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number)\nBICI (Book Item and Component Identifier)\nBook sources search – a Wikipedia resource that allows search by ISBNs\nCODEN (serial publication identifier currently used by libraries; replaced by the ISSN for new works)\nDOI (Digital Object Identifier)\nESTC (English Short Title Catalogue)\nISAN (International Standard Audiovisual Number)\nISRC (International Standard Recording Code)\nISTC (International Standard Text Code)\nISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code)\nISSN (International Standard Serial Number)\nISWN (International Standard Wine Number)\nLCCN (Library of Congress Control Number)\nLicense number (East German books) (Book identification system used between 1951 and 1990 in the former GDR)\nList of group-0 ISBN publisher codes\nList of group-1 ISBN publisher codes\nList of ISBN registration groups\nSICI (Serial Item and Contribution Identifier)\nVD 16 (Verzeichnis der im deutschen Sprachbereich erschienenen Drucke des 16.

Conversely, the same book can be published with several ISBNs: A German second-language edition of Emil und die Detektive has the ISBNs 87-23-90157-8 (Denmark), 0-8219-1069-8 (United States), 91-21-15628-X (Sweden), 0-85048-548-7 (United Kingdom) and 3-12-675495-3 (Germany).\n\n^ In some cases, books sold only as a set share the same ISBN. For example, the Vance Integral Edition used only two ISBNs for 44 books.\n\n^ a b Publishers were required to convert existing ISBNs from the 10-digit format to the 13-digit format (in their publication records) by 1 January 2007. For existing publications, the new 13-digit ISBN would only need to be added if (and when) a publication was reprinted. During the transition period, publishers were recommended to print both the 10-digit and 13-digit ISBNs on the verso of a publication's title page, but they were required to print only the 13-digit ISBN after 1 January 2007.[3]\n\n^ Some books have several codes in the first block: e.g. A. M. Yaglom's Correlation Theory..., published by Springer Verlag, has two ISBNs, 0-387-96331-6 and 3-540-96331-6. Though Springer's 387 and 540 codes are different for English (0) and German (3); the same item number 96331 produces the same check digit for both (6). Springer uses 431 as the publisher code for Japanese (4), and 4-431-96331-? also has a check digit of 6. Other Springer books in English have publisher code 817, and 0-817-96331-? would also have a check digit of 6. This suggests that special considerations were made for assigning Springer's publisher codes, as random assignments of different publisher codes would not be expected to lead by coincidence to the same check digit every time for the same item number. Finding publisher codes for English and German, say, with this effect would amount to solving a linear equation in modular arithmetic.[original research?]\n\n^ The International ISBN Agency's ISBN User's Manual says: \"The ten-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, which must be separated clearly, by hyphens or spaces\", although omission of separators is permitted for internal data processing. If present, hyphens must be correctly placed.[20] The actual definition for hyphenation contains more than 220 different registration group elements with each one broken down into a few to several ranges for the length of the registrant element (more than 1,000 total). The document defining the ranges, listed by agency, is 29 pages.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ a b c \"ISBN History\". isbn.org. 20 April 2014. Archived from the original on 20 April 2014.

Originally containing digitized back issues of academic journals, it now encompasses books and other primary sources as well as current issues of journals in the humanities and social sciences.[3] It provides full-text searches of almost 2,000 journals. Most access is by subscription but some of the site is public domain, and open access content is available free of charge.[4] \nJSTOR is part of the non-profit US academic digital library and learning platform provider, Ithaka Harbors, Inc.[5]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nWilliam G. Bowen, president of Princeton University from 1972 to 1988,[6] founded JSTOR in 1994. JSTOR was originally conceived as a solution to one of the problems faced by libraries, especially research and university libraries, due to the increasing number of academic journals in existence. Most libraries found it prohibitively expensive in terms of cost and space to maintain a comprehensive collection of journals. By digitizing many journal titles, JSTOR allowed libraries to outsource the storage of journals with the confidence that they would remain available long-term. Online access and full-text searchability improved access dramatically.[7]\nBowen initially considered using CD-ROMs for distribution.[8] However, Ira Fuchs, Princeton University's vice president for Computing and Information Technology, convinced Bowen that CD-ROM was becoming an increasingly outdated technology and that network distribution could eliminate redundancy and increase accessibility (for example, all Princeton's administrative and academic buildings were networked by 1989; the student dormitory network was completed in 1994; and campus networks like the one at Princeton were, in turn, linked to larger networks such as BITNET and the Internet). JSTOR was initiated in 1995 at seven different library sites, and originally encompassed ten economics and history journals. JSTOR access improved based on feedback from its initial sites, and it became a fully searchable index accessible from any ordinary web browser. Special software was put in place to make pictures and graphs clear and readable.[9]\nWith the success of this limited project, Bowen, Fuchs, and Kevin Guthrie, the then-president of JSTOR, wanted to expand the number of participating journals. They met with representatives of the Royal Society of London and an agreement was made to digitize the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society dating from its beginning in 1665. The work of adding these volumes to JSTOR was completed by December 2000.[9] In 1999 JSTOR started a partnership with Joint Information Systems Committee and created a mirror website at the University of Manchester to make the JSTOR database available to over 20 higher education institutions in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[10]\nThe Andrew W. Mellon Foundation funded JSTOR initially. Until January 2009, JSTOR operated as an independent, self-sustaining nonprofit organization with offices in New York City and in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Then JSTOR merged with the nonprofit Ithaka Harbors, Inc.[5]—a nonprofit organization founded in 2003 and \"dedicated to helping the academic community take full advantage of rapidly advancing information and networking technologies\".[1]\nIn 2019, JSTOR's revenue was $79 million.[11]\n\nContent[edit]\nJSTOR content is provided by more than 900 publishers.[12] The database contains more than 12 million journal articles, in more than 75 disciplines.[5] Each object is uniquely identified by an integer value, starting at 1, which is used to create a stable URL.[13]\nIn addition to the main site, the JSTOR labs group operates an open service that allows access to the contents of the archives for the purposes of corpus analysis at its Data for Research service.[14] This site offers a search facility with graphical indication of the article coverage and loose integration into the main JSTOR site. Users may create focused sets of articles and then request a dataset containing word and n-gram frequencies and basic metadata. They are notified when the dataset is ready and may download it in either XML or CSV formats. The service does not offer full-text, although academics may request that from JSTOR, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.[citation needed]\nJSTOR Plant Science[15] is available in addition to the main site. JSTOR Plant Science provides access to content such as plant type specimens, taxonomic structures, scientific literature, and related materials and aimed at those researching, teaching, or studying botany, biology, ecology, environmental, and conservation studies. The materials on JSTOR Plant Science are contributed through the Global Plants Initiative (GPI)[16] and are accessible only to JSTOR and GPI members. Two partner networks are contributing to this: the African Plants Initiative, which focuses on plants from Africa, and the Latin American Plants Initiative, which contributes plants from Latin America.[17]\nJSTOR launched its Books at JSTOR program in November 2012, adding 15,000 current and backlist books to its site. The books are linked with reviews and from citations in journal articles.[18]\nIn September 2014, JSTOR launched JSTOR Daily, an online magazine meant to bring academic research to a broader audience. Posted articles are generally based on JSTOR entries, and some entries provide the backstory to current events.[19]\nReveal Digital is a JSTOR-hosted collection of documents produced by or about underground, marginalized and dissenting 20th century communities.[20] Reveal Digital's open access content includes zines, prison newspapers, AIDS art, student-movement documents, black civil rights materials, and a white supremacy archive.[20]\n\nAccess[edit]\nJSTOR is licensed mainly to academic institutions, public libraries, research institutions, museums, and schools. More than 7,000 institutions in more than 150 countries have access.[3] JSTOR has been running a pilot program of allowing subscribing institutions to provide access to their alumni, in addition to current students and staff. The Alumni Access Program officially launched in January 2013.[21] Individual subscriptions also are available to certain journal titles through the journal publisher.[22] Every year, JSTOR blocks 150 million attempts by non-subscribers to read articles.[23]\nInquiries have been made about the possibility of making JSTOR open access. According to Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig, JSTOR had been asked, \"How much would it cost to make this available to the whole world? What would we have to pay you?\", reportedly responding with a figure of $250 million dollars.[24]\n\nAaron Swartz incident[edit]\nMain article: United States v. Aaron Swartz\nSee also: Aaron Swartz § United States v. Aaron Swartz case\nIn late 2010 and early 2011, Aaron Swartz, an American computer programmer, writer, political organizer and Internet activist, used MIT's data network to bulk-download a substantial portion of JSTOR's collection of academic journal articles.[25][26] When the bulk-download was discovered, a video camera was placed in the room to film the mysterious visitor and the relevant computer was left untouched. Once video was captured of the visitor, the download was stopped and Swartz was identified. Rather than pursue a civil lawsuit against him, in June 2011 JSTOR reached a settlement wherein Swartz surrendered the downloaded data.[25][26]\nThe following month, federal authorities charged Swartz with several data theft–related crimes, including wire fraud, computer fraud, unlawfully obtaining information from a protected computer, and recklessly damaging a protected computer.[27][28] Prosecutors in the case claimed that Swartz acted with the intention of making the papers available on P2P file-sharing sites.[26][29]\nSwartz surrendered to authorities, pleaded not guilty to all counts, and was released on $100,000 bail. In September 2012, U.S. attorneys increased the number of charges against Swartz from four to thirteen, with a possible penalty of 35 years in prison and $1 million in fines.[30][31] The case still was pending when Swartz died by suicide in January 2013.[32]\n\nLimitations[edit]\nThe availability of most journals on JSTOR is controlled by a \"moving wall\", which is an agreed-upon delay between the current volume of the journal and the latest volume available on JSTOR. This time period is specified by agreement between JSTOR and the publisher of the journal, which usually is three to five years. Publishers may request that the period of a \"moving wall\" be changed or request discontinuation of coverage. Formerly, publishers also could request that the \"moving wall\" be changed to a \"fixed wall\"—a specified date after which JSTOR would not add new volumes to its database. As of November 2010[update], \"fixed wall\" agreements were still in effect with three publishers of 29 journals made available[needs update] online through sites controlled by the publishers.[33]\nIn 2010, JSTOR started adding current issues of certain journals through its Current Scholarship Program.[34]\n\nIncreasing public access[edit]\nBeginning September 6, 2011, JSTOR made public domain content available at no charge to the public.[35][36] This \"Early Journal Content\" program constitutes about 6% of JSTOR's total content, and includes over 500,000 documents from more than 200 journals that were published before 1923 in the United States, and before 1870 in other countries.[35][36][37] JSTOR stated that it had been working on making this material free for some time. The Swartz controversy and Greg Maxwell's protest torrent of the same content led JSTOR to \"press ahead\" with the initiative.[35][36] As of 2017[update], JSTOR does not have plans to extend it to other public domain content, stating that \"We do not believe that just because something is in the public domain, it can always be provided for free\".[38]\nIn January 2012, JSTOR started a pilot program, \"Register & Read\", offering limited no-cost access (not open access) to archived articles for individuals who register for the service. At the conclusion of the pilot, in January 2013, JSTOR expanded Register & Read from an initial 76 publishers to include about 1,200 journals from over 700 publishers.[39] Registered readers may read up to six articles online every calendar month, but may not print or download PDFs.[40]\nIn 2013, more than 8,000 institutions in more than 160 countries had access to JSTOR.[12]\nAs of 2014, JSTOR is conducting a pilot program with Wikipedia, whereby established editors are given reading privileges through the Wikipedia Library, as with a university library.[41][42]\n\nUsage[edit]\nIn 2012, JSTOR users performed nearly 152 million searches, with more than 113 million article views and 73.5 million article downloads.[12] JSTOR has been used as a resource for linguistics research to investigate trends in language use over time and also to analyze gender differences and inequities in scholarly publishing, revealing that in certain fields, men predominate in the prestigious first and last author positions and that women are significantly underrepresented as authors of single-authored papers.[43][44][45]\nJSTOR metadata is available through CrossRef and the Unpaywall dump,[46] which as of 2020 identifies nearly 3 million works hosted by JSTOR as toll access, as opposed to over 200,000 available in open access (mainly through third party open access repositories).[citation needed]\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nLiterature portalInternet portalNew York City portal\n\nAluka\nAnna's Archive\nArtstor\nArXiv\nDigital preservation\nHAL (open archive)\nJapanese Historical Text Initiative\nJHOVE\nList of academic databases and search engines\nProject Muse\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"About\".

Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex of the Greek gods, he is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. He is considered to be the most beautiful god and is represented as the ideal of the kouros (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth). Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu.[3]\nAs the patron deity of Delphi (Apollo Pythios), Apollo is an oracular god—the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle and also the deity of ritual purification. His oracles were often consulted for guidance in various matters. He was in general seen as the god who affords help and wards off evil, and is referred to as Alexicacus, the \"averter of evil\". Medicine and healing are associated with Apollo, whether through the god himself or mediated through his son Asclepius. Apollo delivered people from epidemics, yet he is also a god who could bring ill health and deadly plague with his arrows. The invention of archery itself is credited to Apollo and his sister Artemis. Apollo is usually described as carrying a silver or golden bow and a quiver of arrows.\nAs the god of mousike,[b] Apollo presides over all music, songs, dance, and poetry. He is the inventor of string-music and the frequent companion of the Muses, functioning as their chorus leader in celebrations. The lyre is a common attribute of Apollo. Protection of the young is one of the best attested facets of his panhellenic cult persona. As a kourotrophos, Apollo is concerned with the health and education of children, and he presided over their passage into adulthood. Long hair, which was the prerogative of boys, was cut at the coming of age (ephebeia) and dedicated to Apollo. The god himself is depicted with long, uncut hair to symbolise his eternal youth.\nApollo is an important pastoral deity, and he was the patron of herdsmen and shepherds. Protection of herds, flocks and crops from diseases, pests and predators were his primary rustic duties. On the other hand, Apollo also encouraged the founding of new towns and the establishment of civil constitutions, is associated with dominion over colonists, and was the giver of laws. His oracles were often consulted before setting laws in a city. Apollo Agyieus was the protector of the streets, public places and home entrances.[4]\nIn Hellenistic times, especially during the 5th century BCE, as Apollo Helios he became identified among Greeks with Helios, the personification of the Sun.[5] Although Latin theological works from at least 1st century BCE identified Apollo with Sol,[6][7] there was no conflation between the two among the classical Latin poets until 1st century CE.[8]\n\n\nEtymology\nApollo, fresco from Pompeii, 1st century AD\nApollo (Attic, Ionic, and Homeric Greek: Ἀπόλλων, Apollōn (GEN Ἀπόλλωνος); Doric: Ἀπέλλων, Apellōn; Arcadocypriot: Ἀπείλων, Apeilōn; Aeolic: Ἄπλουν, Aploun; Latin: Apollō)\nThe name Apollo—unlike the related older name Paean—is generally not found in the Linear B (Mycenean Greek) texts, although there is a possible attestation in the lacunose form ]pe-rjo-[ (Linear B: ]𐀟𐁊-[) on the KN E 842 tablet,[9][10][11] though it has also been suggested that the name might actually read \"Hyperion\" ([u]-pe-rjo-[ne]).[12]\nThe etymology of the name is uncertain. The spelling Ἀπόλλων (pronounced [a.pól.lɔːn] in Classical Attic) had almost superseded all other forms by the beginning of the common era, but the Doric form, Apellon (Ἀπέλλων), is more archaic, as it is derived from an earlier *Ἀπέλjων. It probably is a cognate to the Doric month Apellaios (Ἀπελλαῖος),[13] and the offerings apellaia (ἀπελλαῖα) at the initiation of the young men during the family-festival apellai (ἀπέλλαι).[14][15] According to some scholars, the words are derived from the Doric word apella (ἀπέλλα), which originally meant \"wall\", \"fence for animals\" and later \"assembly within the limits of the square\".[16][17] Apella (Ἀπέλλα) is the name of the popular assembly in Sparta,[16] corresponding to the ecclesia (ἐκκλησία). R. S. P. Beekes rejected the connection of the theonym with the noun apellai and suggested a Pre-Greek proto-form *Apalyun.[18]\nSeveral instances of popular etymology are attested by ancient authors. Thus, the Greeks most often associated Apollo's name with the Greek verb ἀπόλλυμι (apollymi), \"to destroy\".[19] Plato in Cratylus connects the name with ἀπόλυσις (apolysis), \"redemption\", with ἀπόλουσις (apolousis), \"purification\", and with ἁπλοῦν ([h]aploun), \"simple\",[20] in particular in reference to the Thessalian form of the name, Ἄπλουν, and finally with Ἀειβάλλων (aeiballon), \"ever-shooting\". Hesychius connects the name Apollo with the Doric ἀπέλλα (apella), which means \"assembly\", so that Apollo would be the god of political life, and he also gives the explanation σηκός (sekos), \"fold\", in which case Apollo would be the god of flocks and herds.[21] In the ancient Macedonian language πέλλα (pella) means \"stone\",[22] and some toponyms may be derived from this word: Πέλλα (Pella,[23] the capital of ancient Macedonia) and Πελλήνη (Pellēnē/Pellene).[24]\nThe Hittite form Apaliunas (dx-ap-pa-li-u-na-aš) is attested in the Manapa-Tarhunta letter.[25] The Hittite testimony reflects an early form *Apeljōn, which may also be surmised from the comparison of Cypriot Ἀπείλων with Doric Ἀπέλλων.[26] The name of the Lydian god Qλdãns /kʷʎðãns/ may reflect an earlier /kʷalyán-/ before palatalization, syncope, and the pre-Lydian sound change *y > d.[27] Note the labiovelar in place of the labial /p/ found in pre-Doric Ἀπέλjων and Hittite Apaliunas. A Luwian etymology suggested for Apaliunas makes Apollo \"The One of Entrapment\", perhaps in the sense of \"Hunter\".[28]\n\nGreco-Roman epithets\nApollo's chief epithet was Phoebus (/ˈfiːbəs/ ⓘ FEE-bəs; Φοῖβος, Phoibos Greek pronunciation: [pʰó͜i.bos]), literally \"bright\".[29] It was very commonly used by both the Greeks and Romans for Apollo's role as the god of light.

Some claim that the reason the god was given this name was because he had helped the Athenians overcome the Amazons in their battle, which took place on the seventh of Boedromion, the day the Boedromia were later commemorated. Others claim that the term originated from the fact that, in the battle between Eumolpus and Erechtheus and Ion, Apollo had counselled the Athenians to charge the enemy with a war cry (Βοή) if they were going to win.[51]\nPythaeus (Πυθαεύς; from Pythaeus, the son of Apollo), in Hermione (Argolis) there was a temple of Apollo called Pythaeus, a name they learned from the Argives because according to the poet Telesilla, they were the first Greeks to whose country came Pythaeus, the son of Apollo.[52]\nHorios (Ὅριος; \"of the borders\"), it might be because the Hermionians won a victory, either in war or arbitration, related to the borders of their land, and therefore honored Apollo Horios.[52]\nCeltic epithets and cult titles\nApollo was worshipped throughout the Roman Empire. In the traditionally Celtic lands, he was most often seen as a healing and sun god. He was often equated with Celtic gods of similar character.[53][54]\n\nApollo Atepomarus (\"the great horseman\" or \"possessing a great horse\"). Apollo was worshipped at Mauvières (Indre). Horses were, in the Celtic world, closely linked to the Sun.[55]\nApollo Belenus (\"bright\" or \"brilliant\"). This epithet was given to Apollo in parts of Gaul, Northern Italy and Noricum (part of modern Austria). Apollo Belenus was a healing and sun god.[56]\nApollo Cunomaglus (\"hound lord\"). A title given to Apollo at a shrine at Nettleton Shrub, Wiltshire. May have been a god of healing. Cunomaglus himself may originally have been an independent healing god.[57]\nApollo Grannus. Grannus was a healing spring god, later equated with Apollo.[58][59][60]\nApollo Maponus. A god known from inscriptions in Britain. This may be a local fusion of Apollo and Maponus.\nApollo Moritasgus (\"masses of sea water\").[clarification needed] An epithet for Apollo at Alesia, where he was worshipped as the god of healing and, possibly, of physicians.[61]\nApollo Vindonnus (\"clear light\"). Apollo Vindonnus had a temple at Essarois, near Châtillon-sur-Seine in present-day Burgundy. He was a god of healing, especially of the eyes.[59]\nApollo Virotutis (\"benefactor of mankind\"). Apollo Virotutis was worshipped, among other places, at Fins d'Annecy (Haute-Savoie) and at Jublains (Maine-et-Loire).[60][62]\nOrigins\nOmphalos in the Museum of Delphi\nApollo is considered the most Hellenic (Greek) of the Olympian gods.[63][64][65]\nThe cult centers of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos, date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis, Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of the monstrous serpent Python. For the Greeks, Apollo was the most Greek of all the gods, and through the centuries he acquired different functions. In Archaic Greece he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with \"healing\". In Classical Greece he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil.[66] Walter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed \"a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.\"[67]\n\nHealer and god-protector from evil\nApollo Victorious over the Python by Pietro Francavilla (1591), depicting Apollo's victory over the serpent Python[68] (The Walters Art Museum)\nIn classical times, his major function in popular religion was to keep away evil, and he was therefore called \"apotropaios\" (ἀποτρόπαιος, \"averting evil\") and \"alexikakos\" (ἀλεξίκακος \"keeping off ill\"; from v. ἀλέξω + n. κακόν).[69] Apollo also had many epithets relating to his function as a healer. Some commonly used examples are \"paion\" (παιών literally \"healer\" or \"helper\")[70] \"epikourios\" (ἐπικούριος, \"succouring\"), \"oulios\" (οὔλιος, \"healer, baleful\")[71] and \"loimios\" (λοίμιος, \"of the plague\"). In later writers, the word, \"paion\", usually spelled \"Paean\", becomes a mere epithet of Apollo in his capacity as a god of healing.[72]\nApollo in his aspect of \"healer\" has a connection to the primitive god Paean (Παιών-Παιήων), who did not have a cult of his own. Paean serves as the healer of the gods in the Iliad, and seems to have originated in a pre-Greek religion.[73] It is suggested, though unconfirmed, that he is connected to the Mycenaean figure pa-ja-wo-ne (Linear B: 𐀞𐀊𐀺𐀚).[74][75][76] Paean was the personification of holy songs sung by \"seer-doctors\" (ἰατρομάντεις), which were supposed to cure disease.[77]\nHomer uses the noun Paeon to designate both a god and that god's characteristic song of apotropaic thanksgiving and triumph.[78] Such songs were originally addressed to Apollo and afterwards to other gods: to Dionysus, to Apollo Helios, to Apollo's son Asclepius the healer. About the 4th century BCE, the paean became merely a formula of adulation; its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered. It was in this way that Apollo had become recognized as the god of music. Apollo's role as the slayer of the Python led to his association with battle and victory; hence it became the Roman custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle, when a fleet left the harbour, and also after a victory had been won.[citation needed]\nIn the Iliad, Apollo is the healer under the gods, but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows, similar to the function of the Vedic god of disease Rudra.[79] He sends a plague (λοιμός) to the Achaeans. Knowing that Apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent, they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows, called a hecatomb.[80]\n\nDorian origin\nThe Homeric Hymn to Apollo depicts Apollo as an intruder from the north.[81] The connection with the northern-dwelling Dorians and their initiation festival apellai is reinforced by the month Apellaios in northwest Greek calendars.[82] The family-festival was dedicated to Apollo (Doric: Ἀπέλλων).[83] Apellaios is the month of these rites, and Apellon is the \"megistos kouros\" (the great Kouros).[84] However it can explain only the Doric type of the name, which is connected with the Ancient Macedonian word \"pella\" (Pella), stone. Stones played an important part in the cult of the god, especially in the oracular shrine of Delphi (Omphalos).[85][86]\n\nMinoan origin\nOrnamented golden Minoan labrys\nGeorge Huxley considered the identification of Apollo with the Minoan deity Paiawon, worshipped in Crete, to have originated at Delphi.[87] In the Homeric Hymn, Apollo appears as a dolphin carrying Cretan priests to Delphi, to which site they evidently transfer their religious practices. Apollo Delphinios or Delphidios was a sea-god worshipped especially in Crete and in the islands.[88] Apollo's sister Artemis, who was the Greek goddess of hunting, is identified with the Minoan goddess Britomartis (Diktynna), and with Laphria the Pre-Greek \"mistress of the animals\" who was specially worshipped at Delphi. In her earliest depictions she was accompanied by the \"Master of the animals\", a bow-wielding god of hunting whose name has been lost; aspects of this figure may have been absorbed into the more popular Apollo.[89] A family of priests at Delphi was named \"Lab(r)yaden\". The name may derive from Laphria.[90]\n\nAnatolian origin\nIllustration of a coin of Apollo Agyieus from Ambracia\nA non-Greek origin of Apollo has long been assumed in scholarship.[13] The name of Apollo's mother Leto has Lydian origin, and she was worshipped on the coasts of Asia Minor. The inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into Greece from Anatolia, which is the origin of Sibyl, and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated. Omens, symbols, purifications, and exorcisms appear in old Assyro-Babylonian texts. These rituals were spread into the empire of the Hittites, and from there into Greece.[91]\nHomer pictures Apollo on the side of the Trojans, fighting against the Achaeans, during the Trojan War. He is pictured as a terrible god, less trusted by the Greeks than other gods. The god seems to be related to Appaliunas, a tutelary god of Wilusa (Troy) in Asia Minor, but the word is not complete.[92] The stones found in front of the gates of Homeric Troy were the symbols of Apollo. A western Anatolian origin may also be bolstered by references to the parallel worship of Artimus (Artemis) and Qλdãns, whose name may be cognate with the Hittite and Doric forms, in surviving Lydian texts.[93] However, recent scholars have cast doubt on the identification of Qλdãns with Apollo.[94]\nThe Greeks gave to him the name ἀγυιεύς agyieus as the protector god of public places and houses who wards off evil and his symbol was a tapered stone or column.[95] However, while usually Greek festivals were celebrated at the full moon, all the feasts of Apollo were celebrated on the seventh day of the month, and the emphasis given to that day (sibutu) indicates a Babylonian origin.[96]\n\nProto-Indo-European\nThe Vedic Rudra has some functions similar to those of Apollo. The terrible god is called \"the archer\" and the bow is also an attribute of Shiva.[97] Rudra could bring diseases with his arrows, but he was able to free people of them and his alternative Shiva is a healer physician god.[98] However the Indo-European component of Apollo does not explain his strong association with omens, exorcisms, and an oracular cult.[citation needed]\n\nOracular cult\nColumns of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece\nOracular tripod\nUnusually among the Olympic deities, Apollo had two cult sites that had widespread influence: Delos and Delphi. In cult practice, Delian Apollo and Pythian Apollo (the Apollo of Delphi) were so distinct that they might both have shrines in the same locality.[65] Lycia was sacred to the god, for this Apollo was also called Lycian.[99][100] Apollo's cult was already fully established when written sources commenced, about 650 BCE. Apollo became extremely important to the Greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic period, and the frequency of theophoric names such as Apollodorus or Apollonios and cities named Apollonia testify to his popularity. Oracular sanctuaries to Apollo were established in other sites. In the 2nd and 3rd century CE, those at Didyma and Claros pronounced the so-called \"theological oracles\", in which Apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an all-encompassing, highest deity. \"In the 3rd century, Apollo fell silent. Julian the Apostate (359–361) tried to revive the Delphic oracle, but failed.\"[13]\n\nOracular shrines\nDelos lions\nApollo had a famous oracle in Delphi, and other notable ones in Claros and Didyma. His oracular shrine in Abae in Phocis, where he bore the toponymic epithet Abaeus (Ἀπόλλων Ἀβαῖος, Apollon Abaios), was important enough to be consulted by Croesus.[101] His oracular shrines include:\n\nAbae in Phocis.\nBassae in the Peloponnese.\nAt Clarus, on the west coast of Asia Minor; as at Delphi a holy spring which gave off a pneuma, from which the priests drank.\nIn Corinth, the Oracle of Corinth came from the town of Tenea, from prisoners supposedly taken in the Trojan War.\nAt Khyrse, in Troad, the temple was built for Apollo Smintheus.\nIn Delos, there was an oracle to the Delian Apollo, during summer. The Hieron (Sanctuary) of Apollo adjacent to the Sacred Lake, was the place where the god was said to have been born.\nIn Delphi, the Pythia became filled with the pneuma of Apollo, said to come from a spring inside the Adyton.\nIn Didyma, an oracle on the coast of Anatolia, south west of Lydian (Luwian) Sardis, in which priests from the lineage of the Branchidae received inspiration by drinking from a healing spring located in the temple. Was believed to have been founded by Branchus, son or lover of Apollo.\nIn Hierapolis Bambyce, Syria (modern Manbij), according to the treatise De Dea Syria, the sanctuary of the Syrian Goddess contained a robed and bearded image of Apollo. Divination was based on spontaneous movements of this image.[102]\nAt Patara, in Lycia, there was a seasonal winter oracle of Apollo, said to have been the place where the god went from Delos. As at Delphi the oracle at Patara was a woman.\nIn Segesta in Sicily.\nOracles were also given by sons of Apollo.\n\nIn Oropus, north of Athens, the oracle Amphiaraus, was said to be the son of Apollo; Oropus also had a sacred spring.\nin Labadea, 20 miles (32 km) east of Delphi, Trophonius, another son of Apollo, killed his brother and fled to the cave where he was also afterwards consulted as an oracle.\nTemples of Apollo\nMain articles: Ancient Greek temple and Roman temple\nPartial view of the temple of Apollo Epikurios (healer) at Bassae in southern Greece\nMany temples were dedicated to Apollo in Greece and the Greek colonies. They show the spread of the cult of Apollo and the evolution of Greek architecture, which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations. Some of the earliest temples, especially in Crete, do not belong to any Greek order. It seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures. The different wooden elements were considered divine, and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of Doric order. The Greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances. The temples should be canonic, and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfection.[103] From the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings. The first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof, and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms. This probably influenced the theory of numbers of Pythagoras, who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematics.[104]\nThe Doric order dominated during the 6th and the 5th century BC but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs, which could not be solved without changing the original forms. The order was almost abandoned for the Ionic order, but the Ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple. Both orders were abandoned for the Corinthian order gradually during the Hellenistic age and under Rome.[citation needed]\nThe most important temples are:\n\nGreek temples\nTemple of the Delians at Delos, dedicated to Apollo (478 BC). 19th-century pen-and-wash restoration.\nGate at the Temple of Apollo (Naxos)\nThebes, Greece: The oldest temple probably dedicated to Apollo Ismenius was built in the 9th century BC. It seems that it was a curvilinear building. The Doric temple was built in the early 7th century BC, but only some small parts have been found.[105] A festival called Daphnephoria was celebrated every ninth year in honour of Apollo Ismenius (or Galaxius). The people held laurel branches (daphnai), and at the head of the procession walked a youth (chosen priest of Apollo), who was called \"daphnephoros\".[106]\nEretria: According to the Homeric hymn to Apollo, the god arrived on the plain, seeking for a location to establish its oracle. The first temple of Apollo Daphnephoros, \"Apollo, laurel-bearer\", or \"carrying off Daphne\", is dated to 800 BC. The temple was curvilinear hecatombedon (a hundred feet). In a smaller building were kept the bases of the laurel branches which were used for the first building. Another temple probably peripteral was built in the 7th century BC, with an inner row of wooden columns over its Geometric predecessor. It was rebuilt peripteral around 510 BC, with the stylobate measuring 21.00 x 43.00 m. The number of pteron column was 6 x 14.[107][108]\nDreros (Crete). The temple of Apollo Delphinios dates from the 7th century BC, or probably from the middle of the 8th century BC. According to the legend, Apollo appeared as a dolphin, and carried Cretan priests to the port of Delphi.[109] The dimensions of the plan are 10.70 x 24.00 m and the building was not peripteral. It contains column-bases of the Minoan type, which may be considered as the predecessors of the Doric columns.[110]\nGortyn (Crete). A temple of Pythian Apollo, was built in the 7th century BC. The plan measured 19.00 x 16.70 m and it was not peripteral. The walls were solid, made from limestone, and there was a single door on the east side.[citation needed]\nThermon (West Greece): The Doric temple of Apollo Thermios, was built in the middle of the 7th century BC. It was built on an older curvilinear building dating perhaps from the 10th century, on which a peristyle was added. The temple was narrow, and the number of pteron columns (probably wooden) was 5 x 15. There was a single row of inner columns. It measures 12.13 x 38.23 m at the stylobate, which was made from stones.[111]\nFloor plan of the temple of Apollo, Corinth\nCorinth: A Doric temple was built in the 6th century BC. The temple's stylobate measures 21.36 x 53.30 m, and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 15. There was a double row of inner columns. The style is similar to the Temple of Alcmeonidae at Delphi.[112] The Corinthians were considered to be the inventors of the Doric order.[111]\nNapes (Lesbos): An Aeolic temple probably of Apollo Napaios was built in the 7th century BC. Some special capitals with floral ornament have been found, which are called Aeolic, and it seems that they were borrowed from the East.[113]\nCyrene, Libya: The oldest Doric temple of Apollo was built in c. 600 BC. The number of pteron columns was 6 x 11, and it measures 16.75 x 30.05 m at the stylobate. There was a double row of sixteen inner columns on stylobates. The capitals were made from stone.[113]\nInscriptions for Apollo, Naukratis\nNaukratis: An Ionic temple was built in the early 6th century BC. Only some fragments have been found and the earlier ones, made from limestone, are identified among the oldest of the Ionic order.[114]\nFloor plan of the temple of Apollo, Syracuse\nSyracuse, Sicily: A Doric temple was built at the beginning of the 6th century BC. The temple's stylobate measures 21.47 x 55.36 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. It was the first temple in Greek west built completely out of stone. A second row of columns were added, obtaining the effect of an inner porch.[115]\nSelinus (Sicily):The Doric Temple C dates from 550 BC, and it was probably dedicated to Apollo. The temple's stylobate measures 10.48 x 41.63 m and the number of pteron columns was 6 x 17. There was a portico with a second row of columns, which is also attested for the temple at Syracuse.[116]\nDelphi: The first temple dedicated to Apollo, was built in the 7th century BC. According to the legend, it was wooden made of laurel branches. The \"Temple of Alcmeonidae\" was built in c. 513 BC and it is the oldest Doric temple with significant marble elements. The temple's stylobate measures 21.65 x 58.00 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 15.[117] A fest similar with Apollo's fest at Thebes, Greece was celebrated every nine years. A boy was sent to the temple, who walked on the sacred road and returned carrying a laurel branch (dopnephoros). The maidens participated with joyful songs.[106]\nChios: An Ionic temple of Apollo Phanaios was built at the end of the 6th century BC. Only some small parts have been found and the capitals had floral ornament.[113]\nAbae (Phocis). The temple was destroyed by the Persians in the invasion of Xerxes in 480 BC, and later by the Boeotians. It was rebuilt by Hadrian.[118] The oracle was in use from early Mycenaean times to the Roman period, and shows the continuity of Mycenaean and Classical Greek religion.[119]\nFloor plan of the Temple of Apollo at Bassae\nBassae (Peloponnesus): A temple dedicated to Apollo Epikourios (\"Apollo the helper\"), was built in 430 BC, designed by Iktinos. It combined Doric and Ionic elements, and the earliest use of a column with a Corinthian capital in the middle.[120] The temple is of a relatively modest size, with the stylobate measuring 14.5 x 38.3 metres containing a Doric peristyle of 6 x 15 columns. The roof left a central space open to admit light and air.[121]\nDelos: A temple probably dedicated to Apollo and not peripteral, was built in the late 7th century BC, with a plan measuring 10.00 x 15.60 m. The Doric Great temple of Apollo, was built in c. 475 BC. The temple's stylobate measures 13.72 x 29.78 m, and the number of pteron columns as 6 x 13. Marble was extensively used.[113]\nAmbracia: A Doric peripteral temple dedicated to Apollo Pythios Sotir was built in 500 BC, at the centre of the Greek city Arta. Only some parts have been found, and it seems that the temple was built on earlier sanctuaries dedicated to Apollo. The temple measures 20.75 x 44.00 m at the stylobate. The foundation which supported the statue of the god, still exists.[122]\nTemple of Apollo, Didyma\nDidyma (near Miletus): The gigantic Ionic temple of Apollo Didymaios started around 540 BC. The construction ceased and then it was restarted in 330 BC. The temple is dipteral, with an outer row of 10 x 21 columns, and it measures 28.90 x 80.75 m at the stylobate.[123]\nClarus (near ancient Colophon): According to the legend, the famous seer Calchas, on his return from Troy, came to Clarus. He challenged the seer Mopsus, and died when he lost.[124] The Doric temple of Apollo Clarius was probably built in the 3rd century BC., and it was peripteral with 6 x 11 columns. It was reconstructed at the end of the Hellenistic period, and later from the emperor Hadrian but Pausanias claims that it was still incomplete in the 2nd century BC.[125]\nHamaxitus (Troad): In the Iliad, Chryses the priest of Apollo, addresses the god with the epithet Smintheus (Lord of Mice), related to the god's ancient role as bringer of the disease (plague). Recent excavations indicate that the Hellenistic temple of Apollo Smintheus was constructed in 150–125 BC, but the symbol of the mouse god was used on coinage probably from the 4th century .[126] The temple measures 40.00 x 23.00 m at the stylobate, and the number of pteron columns was 8 x 14.[127]\nPythion (Ancient Greek: Πύθιον), this was the name of a shrine of Apollo at Athens near the Ilisos river. It was created by Peisistratos, and tripods were placed there by those who had won in the cyclic chorus at the Thargelia.[128]\nSetae (Lydia): The temple of Apollo Aksyros located in the city.[129]\nApollonia Pontica: There were two temples of Apollo Healer in the city. One from the Late Archaic period and the other from the Early Classical period.[130]\nIkaros island in the Persian Gulf (modern Failaka Island): There was a temple of Apollo on the island.[131]\nArgos in Cyprus: there was a temple of Apollo Erithios (Ἐριθίου Ἀπόλλωνος ἱερῷ).[132]\nThe temple and oracle of Apollo at Eutresis.[40]\nAn altar of Apollo Acritas was  at Lacedaemon. In addition, above a sanctuary surnamed Gasepton of Earth in Lacedaemon was set up the Maleatian Apollo.[133]\nEtruscan and Roman temples\nVeii (Etruria): The temple of Apollo was built in the late 6th century BC, indicating the spread of Apollo's culture (Aplu) in Etruria. There was a prostyle porch, which is called Tuscan, and a triple cella 18.50 m wide.[134]\nFalerii Veteres (Etruria): A temple of Apollo was built probably in the 4th–3rd century BC. Parts of a terracotta capital, and a terracotta base have been found. It seems that the Etruscan columns were derived from the archaic Doric.[134] A cult of Apollo Soranus is attested by one inscription found near Falerii.[135]\nArtist's reconstruction of the Temple of Apollo (Pompeii)\nPompeii (Italy): The cult of Apollo was widespread in the region of Campania since the 6th century BC. The temple was built in 120 BC, but its beginnings lie in the 6th century BC. It was reconstructed after an earthquake in AD 63. It demonstrates a mixing of styles which formed the basis of Roman architecture. The columns in front of the cella formed a Tuscan prostyle porch, and the cella is situated unusually far back. The peripteral colonnade of 48 Ionic columns was placed in such a way that the emphasis was given to the front side.[136]\nTemple of Apollo Sosianus, Rome\nRome: The temple of Apollo Sosianus and the temple of Apollo Medicus. The first temple building dates to 431 BC, and was dedicated to Apollo Medicus (the doctor), after a plague of 433 BC.[137] It was rebuilt by Gaius Sosius, probably in 34 BC. Only three columns with Corinthian capitals exist today. It seems that the cult of Apollo had existed in this area since at least to the mid-5th century BC.[138]\nRome: The temple of Apollo Palatinus was located on the Palatine hill within the sacred boundary of the city. It was dedicated by Augustus in 28 BC. The façade of the original temple was Ionic and it was constructed from solid blocks of marble. Many famous statues by Greek masters were on display in and around the temple, including a marble statue of the god at the entrance and a statue of Apollo in the cella.[139]\nMelite (modern Mdina, Malta): A Temple of Apollo was built in the city in the 2nd century AD. Its remains were discovered in the 18th century, and many of its architectural fragments were dispersed among private collections or reworked into new sculptures. Parts of the temple's podium were rediscovered in 2002.[140]\nMythology\nThis section may be too long to read and navigate comfortably.

Please discuss this issue on the article's talk page. (September 2025)\nMain article: Greek mythology\nIn the myths, Apollo is the son of Zeus, the king of the gods, and Leto, his previous wife[141] or one of his mistresses. Apollo often appears in the myths, plays and hymns either directly or indirectly through his oracles. As Zeus's favorite son, he had direct access to the mind of Zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans. A divinity beyond human comprehension, he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god.[citation needed]\n\nBirth\nLeto fleeing with Artemis and Apollo, AD 350–400, in Kunstsien Stichting\nHomeric Hymn to Apollo\nPregnant with the offspring of Zeus, Leto wandered through many lands wanting to give birth to Apollo. However all the lands rejected her out of fear. Upon reaching Delos, Leto requested the island to shelter her, and that in return her son would bring fame and prosperity to the island. Delos then revealed to Leto that Apollo was rumoured to be the god who will \"greatly lord it among gods and men all over the fruitful earth\". For this reason, all the lands were fearful and Delos feared that Apollo would cast her aside once he is born. Hearing this, Leto swore on the river Styx that if she is allowed to give birth on the island, her son would honour Delos the most amongst all the other lands. Assured by this, Delos agreed to assist Leto. All goddesses except Hera also came to aid Leto.[142]\nHowever, Hera had tricked Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to stay on Olympus, due to which Leto was unable to give birth. The goddesses then convinced Iris to go bring Eileithyia by offering her a necklace of amber 9 yards (8.2 m) long. Iris did accordingly and persuaded Eileithyia to step onto the island. Thus, clutching a palm tree, Leto finally gave birth after labouring for nine days and nine nights, with Apollo \"leaping forth\" from his mother's womb. The goddesses washed the newborn, covered him in a white garment and fastened golden bands around him. As Leto was unable to feed him, Themis, the goddess of divine law, fed him nectar and ambrosia. Upon tasting the divine food, the child broke free of the bands fastened onto him and declared that he would be the master of lyre and archery, and interpret the will of Zeus to humankind. He then started to walk, which caused the island to be filled with gold.[142]\n\nCallimachus's Hymn to Delos\nThe island Delos used to be Asteria, a goddess who jumped into the waters to escape the advances of Zeus and became a free-floating island of the same name. When Leto got pregnant, Hera was told that Leto's son would become more dear to Zeus than Ares. Enraged by this, Hera watched over the heavens and sent out Ares and Iris to prevent Leto from giving birth on the earth. Ares, stationed over the mainland, and Iris, over the islands, threatened all the lands and prevented them from helping Leto.[143]\nWhen Leto arrived at Thebes, fetal Apollo prophesied from his mother's womb that in the future he would punish a slanderous woman in Thebes (Niobe), so he did not want to be born there. Leto then went to Thessaly and sought the help of the river nymphs who were the daughters of the river Peneus. Though he was initially fearful and reluctant, Peneus later decided to let Leto give birth in his waters. He did not change his mind even when Ares produced a terrifying sound and threatened to hurl mountain peaks into the river. But Leto herself declined his help and departed, as she did not want him to suffer for her sake.[143]\nAfter being turned away from various lands, Apollo spoke again from the womb, asking his mother to take look at the floating island in front of her and expressing his wish to be born there. When Leto approached Asteria, all the other islands fled. But Asteria welcomed Leto without any fear of Hera. Walking on the island, she sat down against a palm tree and asked Apollo to be born. During the childbirth, swans circled the island seven times, a sign that later on Apollo would play the seven-stringed lyre. When Apollo finally \"leapt forth\" from his mother's womb, the nymphs of the island sang a hymn to Eileithyia that was heard to the heavens. The moment Apollo was born, the entire island, including the trees and the waters, became gold. Asteria bathed the newborn, swaddled him and fed him with her breast milk. The island had become rooted and was later called Delos.[143]\nHera was no longer angry, as Zeus had managed to calm her down; and she held no grudge against Asteria, since Asteria had rejected Zeus in the past.[143]\n\nLeto with her children, by William Henry Rinehart\nPindar\nPindar is the earliest source who explicitly calls Apollo and Artemis as twins. Here, Asteria is also stated to be Leto's sister. Wanting to escape Zeus's advances, she flung herself into the sea and became a floating rock called Ortygia until the twins were born.[144] When Leto stepped on the rock, four pillars with adamantine bases rose from the earth and held up the rock.[145] When Apollo and Artemis were born, their bodies shone radiantly and a chant was sung by Eileithyia and Lachesis, one of the three Moirai.[146]\n\nHyginus\nScorning the advances of Zeus, Asteria transformed herself into a bird and jumped into a sea. From her, an island rose which was called Ortygia.[147] When Hera discovered that Leto was pregnant with Zeus's child, she decreed that Leto can give birth only in a place where sun does not shine. During this time, the monster Python also started hounding Leto with an intent of killing her, because he had foreseen his death coming at the hands of Leto's offspring. However, on Zeus's orders, Boreas carried away Leto and entrusted her to Poseidon. To protect her, Poseidon took her to the island Ortygia and covered it with waves so that the sun would not shine on it. Leto gave birth clinging to an olive tree and henceforth the island was called Delos.[148]\n\nLeto with Apollo and Artemis, by Francesco Pozzi\nOther variations\nAside from those mentioned above, more variations on the story of Apollo's birth include:\nAelian states that it took Leto twelve days and twelve nights to travel from Hyperborea to Delos.[149] Leto changed herself into a she-wolf before giving birth. This is given as the reason why Homer describes Apollo as the \"wolf-born god\".[150][151]\nLibanius wrote that neither land nor visible islands would receive Leto, but by the will of Zeus Delos then became visible, and thus received Leto and the children.[152]\nAccording to Strabo, the Curetes helped Leto by creating loud noises with their weapons and thus frightening Hera, they concealed Leto's childbirth.[153]\nTheognis wrote that the island was filled with ambrosial fragrance when Apollo was born, and the Earth laughed with joy.[154]\nIn some versions, Artemis was born first and subsequently assisted with the birth of Apollo.[155][156]\nWhile in some accounts Apollo's birth itself fixed the floating Delos to the earth, there are accounts of Apollo securing Delos to the bottom of the ocean a little while later.[157][158] \nThis island became sacred to Apollo and was one of the major cult centres of the god.\nApollo was born on the seventh day (ἑβδομαγενής, hebdomagenes)[159] of the month Thargelion—according to Delian tradition—or of the month Bysios—according to Delphian tradition. The seventh and twentieth, the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held sacred to him.[21]\n\nHyperborea\nApollo head in the Antalya Museum, Turkey\nHyperborea, the mystical land of eternal spring, venerated Apollo above all the gods. The Hyperboreans always sang and danced in his honor and hosted Pythian games.[160] There, a vast forest of beautiful trees was called \"the garden of Apollo\". Apollo spent the winter months among the Hyperboreans,[161][162] leaving his shrine in Delphi under the care of Dionysus. His absence from the world caused coldness and this was marked as his annual death. No prophecies were issued during this time.[163] He returned to the world during the beginning of the spring. The Theophania festival was held in Delphi to celebrate his return.[164]\nHowever, Diodorus Silculus states that Apollo visited Hyperborea every nineteen years. This nineteen-year period was called by the Greeks as the 'year of Meton', the time period in which the stars returned to their initial positions. And that visiting Hyperborea at that time, Apollo played on the cithara and danced continuously from the vernal equinox until the rising of the Pleiades (constellations).[165]\nHyperborea was also Leto's birthplace. It is said that Leto came to Delos from Hyperborea accompanied by a pack of wolves. Henceforth, Hyperborea became Apollo's winter home and wolves became sacred to him. His intimate connection to wolves is evident from his epithet Lyceus, meaning wolf-like. But Apollo was also the wolf-slayer in his role as the god who protected flocks from predators. The Hyperborean worship of Apollo bears the strongest marks of Apollo being worshipped as the sun god. Shamanistic elements in Apollo's cult are often liked to his Hyperborean origin, and he is likewise speculated to have originated as a solar shaman.[166][167] Shamans like Abaris and Aristeas were also the followers of Apollo, who hailed from Hyperborea.[citation needed]\nIn myths, the tears of amber Apollo shed when his son Asclepius died mixed with the waters of the river Eridanos, which surrounded Hyperborea. Apollo also buried in Hyperborea the arrow which he had used to kill the Cyclopes. He later gave this arrow to Abaris.[168]\n\nChildhood and youth\nGrowing up, Apollo was nursed by the nymphs Korythalia and Aletheia, the personification of truth.[169] Phoebe, his grandmother, gave the oracular shrine of Delphi to Apollo as a birthday gift.[170]\nAs a four-year-old child, Apollo built a foundation and an altar on Delos using the horns of the goats that his sister Artemis hunted. Since he learnt the art of building when young, he came to be known as Archegetes, (the founder of towns) and guided men to build new cities.[171] To keep the child amused, the Delian nymphs ran around the altar beating it, and then with their hands tied behind their backs, bit an olive branch. It later became a custom for all the sailors who passed by the island to do the same.[172]\nFrom his father Zeus, Apollo received a golden headband and a chariot driven by swans.[173][174]\nIn his early years when Apollo spent his time herding cows, he was reared by the Thriae, who trained him and enhanced his prophetic skills.[175] The god Pan was also said to have mentored him in the prophetic art.[176] Apollo is also said to have invented the lyre, and along with Artemis, the art of archery. He then taught the humans the art of healing and archery.[177]\n\nLycian peasants\nLatona and the Lycian peasants, by Joshua Cristall\nSoon after giving birth to her twins, Leto fled from Delos fearing Hera. Upon reaching Lycia, her infants had drained all of their mother's milk and cried for more to satisfy their hunger. The exhausted mother then tried drinking from a nearby lake but was stopped by some Lycian peasants. When she begged them to let her quench her thirst, the haughty peasants not only threatened her but also stirred the mud in the lake to dirty the waters. Angered by this, Leto turned them into frogs.[178]\nIn a slightly varied version, Leto took her infants and crossed over to Lycia where she attempted to bathe her children in a spring she found there. But the local herdsmen drove her away. After that, some wolves found Leto and guided her to the river Xanthos, where Leto was able to bathe her children and quench her thirst. She then returned to the spring and turned the herdsmen into frogs.[179]\n\nSlaying of Python\nApollo victorious over the Python, by François Gaspard Adam\nPython, a chthonic serpent-dragon, was a child of Gaia and the guardian of the Delphic Oracle.\nIn Callimachus's hymn to Delos, fetal Apollo foresees the death of Python at his hands.[172]\nIn the Homeric hymn to Apollo, Python was a female drakon and the nurse of the giant Typhon whom Hera had created to overthrow Zeus. She was described as a terrifying monster and a \"bloody plague\". Apollo, in his pursuit to establish his worship, came across Python and killed her with a single arrow shot from his bow. He let the corpse rot under the sun and declared himself the oracular deity of Delphi.[180] Other authors have Apollo kill the monster using a hundred arrows[181][182] or a thousand arrows.[183]\n\nApollo and Python, terracotta relief by Artus Quellinus the Elder (1609–1668)\nAccording to Euripides, Leto had brought her twins to the cliffs of Parnassus shortly after giving birth to them. Upon seeing the monster there, Apollo, still a child being carried in his mother's arms, leapt forth and killed Python.[184] Some authors also mention that Python was killed for displaying lustful affections towards Leto.[185][186]\nIn another account, Python chased pregnant Leto with an intent of killing her because his death was fated to come at the hands of Leto's child. However, he had to stop the chase when Leto came under the protection of Poseidon. After his birth, four days old Apollo killed the serpent with the bow and arrows gifted to him by Hephaestus and avenged the trouble given to his mother. The god then put the bones of the slain monster in a cauldron and deposited it in his temple.[187]\nThis legend is also narrated as the origin of the cry \"Hië paian\". According to Athenaeus, Python attacked Leto and her twins during their visit to Delphi. Taking Artemis into her arms, Leto climbed upon a rock and cried at Apollo to shoot the monster. The cry let out by her, \"ιε, παῖ\" (\"Shoot, boy\") later got slightly altered as \"ἰὴ παιών\" (Hië paian), an exclamation to avert evils.[188] Callimachus attributes the origin of this phrase to the Delphians, who let out the cry to encourage Apollo when the young god battled with Python.[189]\nStrabo has recorded a slightly different version where Python was actually a cruel and lawless man who was also known by the name \"Drakon\". When Apollo was teaching the humans to cultivate fruits and civilise themselves, the residents of Parnassus complained to the god about Python. In response to their pleas, Apollo killed the man with his arrows. During the fight, the Parnassians shouted \"Hië paian\" to encourage the god.[190]\n\nEstablishment of worship in Delphi\nContinuing from his victory over Python, the Homeric hymn describes how the young god established his worship among the humans. As Apollo was pondering about what kind of men he should recruit to serve him, he spotted a ship full of Cretan merchants or pirates. He took the form of a dolphin and sprang aboard the ship. Whenever the oblivious crew members tried throwing the dolphin overboard, the god shook the ship until the crew was awed into submission. Apollo then created a breeze that directed the ship to Delphi. Upon reaching the land, he revealed himself as a god and initiated them as his priests. He instructed them to guard his temple and always keep righteousness in their hearts.[191]\nAlcaeus narrates the following account: Zeus, who had adorned his newborn son with a golden headband, also provided him with a chariot driven by swans and instructed Apollo to visit Delphi to establish his laws among the people. But Apollo disobeyed his father and went to the land of Hyperborea. The Delphians continuously sung paeans in his honour and pleaded him to come back to them. The god returned only after a year and then carried out Zeus's orders.[173][192]\nIn other variations, the shrine at Delphi was simply handed over to Apollo by his grandmother Phoebe as a gift,[170] or Themis herself inspired him to be the oracular voice of Delphi.[193]\n\nPhoebe gifts the oracular tripod to Apollo, by John Flaxman\nHowever, in many other accounts, Apollo had to overcome certain obstacles before he was able to establish himself at Delphi. Gaea came in conflict with Apollo for killing Python and claiming the Delphic oracle for himself. According to Pindar, she sought to banish Apollo to Tartarus as a punishment.[194][195] According to Euripides, soon after Apollo took the ownership of the oracle, Gaea started sending prophetic dreams to the humans. As a result, people stopped visiting Delphi to obtain prophecies. Troubled by this, Apollo went to Olympus and supplicated to Zeus. Zeus, admiring the ambitions of his young son, granted his request by putting an end to the dream visions. This sealed the role of Apollo as the oracular deity of Delphi.[196]\nSince Apollo had committed a blood crime, he also had to be purified. Pausanias has recorded two of the many variations of this purification. In one of them, both Apollo and Artemis fled to Sicyon and were purified there.[197] In the other tradition that had been prevalent among the Cretans, Apollo alone travelled to Crete and was purified by Carmanor.[198] In another account, the Argive king Crotopus was the one who performed the purification rites on Apollo alone.[199]\nAccording the Aristonous and Aelian, Apollo was purified by the will of Zeus in the Vale of Tempe.[200] Aristonous has continued the tale, saying that Apollo was escorted back to Delphi by Athena. As a token of gratitude, he later built a temple for Athena at Delphi, which served as a threshold for his own temple.[201] Upon reaching Delphi, Apollo convinced Gaea and Themis into handing over the seat of oracle to him. To celebrate this event, other immortals also graced Apollo with gifts – Poseidon gave him the land of Delphi, the Delphian nymphs gifted him the Corycian cave, and Artemis set her dogs to patrol and safeguard the land.[202]\nSome others have also said that Apollo was exiled and subjected to servitude under king Admetus as a means of punishment for the murder he had committed.[203] It was when he was serving as a cowherd under Admetus that the theft of the cattle by Hermes happened.[204][205] The servitude was said to have lasted for either one year,[206][207] or one great year (a cycle of eight years),[208][209] or nine years.[210]\nPlutarch, however, has mentioned a variation where Apollo was neither purified in Tempe nor banished to Earth as a servant for nine years, but was driven out to another world for nine great years. The god who returned was cleansed and purified, thus becoming a \"true Phoebus – that is to say, clear and bright\". He then took over the Delphic oracle, which had been under the care of Themis in his absence.[211] Henceforth, Apollo became the god who cleansed himself from the sin of murder, made men aware of their guilt and purified them.[212]\nThe Pythian games were also established by Apollo, either as funeral games to honor Python[187][213] or to celebrate his own victory.[214][215][183] The Pythia was Apollo's high priestess and his mouthpiece through whom he gave prophecies.[216]\n\nTityus\nApollo slaying Tityos, Attic red-figure kylix, 460–450 BC\nTityus was another giant who tried to rape Leto, either on his own accord when she was on her way to Delphi[217][218] or at the order of Hera.[219] Leto called upon on her children who instantly slew the giant. Apollo, still a young boy, shot him with his arrows.[220][221]  In some accounts, Artemis also joined him in protecting their mother by attacking Tityos with her arrows.[222][223] For this act, he was banished to Tartarus and there he was pegged to the rock floor and stretched on an area of 9 acres (36,000 m2), while a pair of vultures feasted daily on his liver[217] or his heart.[218]\nAnother account recorded by Strabo says that Tityus was not a giant but a lawless man whom Apollo killed at the request of the residents.[190]\n\nAdmetus\nApollo guards the herds (or flocks) of King Admetus, by Felice Gianni\nAdmetus was the king of Pherae, who was known for his hospitality. When Apollo was exiled from Olympus for killing Python, he served as a herdsman under Admetus, who was then young and unmarried. Apollo is said to have shared a romantic relationship with Admetus during his stay.[162] After completing his years of servitude, Apollo went back to Olympus as a god.[citation needed]\nBecause Admetus had treated Apollo well, the god conferred great benefits on him in return. Apollo's mere presence is said to have made the cattle give birth to twins.[224][162] Apollo helped Admetus win the hand of Alcestis, the daughter of King Pelias,[225][226] by taming a lion and a boar to draw Admetus's chariot. He was present during their wedding to give his blessings. When Admetus angered the goddess Artemis by forgetting to give her the due offerings, Apollo came to the rescue and calmed his sister.[225] When Apollo learnt of Admetus's untimely death, he convinced or tricked the Fates into letting Admetus live past his time.[225][226]\nAccording to another version, or perhaps some years later, when Zeus struck down Apollo's son Asclepius with a lightning bolt for resurrecting the dead, Apollo in revenge killed the Cyclopes, who had fashioned the bolt for Zeus.[224] Apollo would have been banished to Tartarus for this, but his mother Leto intervened, and reminding Zeus of their old love, pleaded with him not to kill their son. Zeus obliged and sentenced Apollo to one year of hard labor once again under Admetus.[224]\nThe love between Apollo and Admetus was a favored topic of Roman poets like Ovid and Servius.[citation needed]\n\nNiobe\nNiobe's children are killed by Apollo and Diana, by Pierre-Charles Jombert\nThe fate of Niobe was prophesied by Apollo while he was still in Leto's womb.[162] Niobe was the queen of Thebes and wife of Amphion. She displayed hubris when she boasted that she was superior to Leto because she had fourteen children (Niobids), seven male and seven female, while Leto had only two. She further mocked Apollo's effeminate appearance and Artemis's manly appearance. Leto, insulted by this, told her children to punish Niobe. Accordingly, Apollo killed Niobe's sons, and Artemis her daughters. According to some versions of the myth, among the Niobids, Chloris and her brother Amyclas were not killed because they prayed to Leto. Amphion, at the sight of his dead sons, either killed himself or was killed by Apollo after swearing revenge.[citation needed]\nA devastated Niobe fled to Mount Sipylos in Asia Minor and turned into stone as she wept. Her tears formed the river Achelous. Zeus had turned all the people of Thebes to stone and so no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them.[citation needed]\nWhen Chloris married and had children, Apollo granted her son Nestor the years he had taken away from the Niobids. Hence, Nestor was able to live for 3 generations.[227]\n\nBuilding the walls of Troy\nLaomedon refusing payment to Poseidon and Apollo, by Joachim von Sandrart\nTrojan WarAchilles tending the wounded Patroclus(Attic red-figure kylix, c. 500 BC)\nLiterary sources\nIliad\nOdyssey\nEpic Cycle\nAeneid, Book 2\nIphigenia in Aulis\nPhiloctetes\nAjax\nThe Trojan Women\nPosthomerica\nSee also: Trojan War in literature and the arts\n\nEpisodes\nJudgement of Paris\nSeduction of Helen\nTrojan Horse\nSack of Troy\nThe Returns\nWanderings of Odysseus\nAeneas and the Founding of Rome\n\nGreeks and allies\nAgamemnon\nAchilles\nHelen\nMenelaus\nNestor\nOdysseus\nAjax\nDiomedes\nPatroclus\nThersites\nAchaeans\nMyrmidons\n\nSee also: Achaean Leaders, Catalogue of Ships\n\nTrojans and allies\nPriam\nHecuba\nHector\nParis\nHelen\nCassandra\nAndromache\nAeneas\nMemnon\nTroilus\nPenthesilea and the Amazons\nSarpedon\nDeiphobos\nHelenus\n\nSee also: Trojan Battle Order, Trojan Leaders\n\nParticipant godsCaused the war:\nEris\n\nOn the Greek side:\n\nAthena\nHephaestus\nHera\nHermes\nThetis\nPoseidon\n\nOn the Trojan side:\n\nAphrodite\nApollo\nAres\nArtemis\nLeto\nScamander\nZeus\n\nHistoricity\nAhhiyawa\nAlaksandu\nArchaeology of Troy\nAttarsiya\nHisarlık\nHomeric Question\nLate Bronze Age Troy\nManapa-Tarhunta letter\nMilawata letter\nTawagalawa letter\nTrojan language\nWilusa\n\nSee also: Historicity of the Iliad\n\nRelated topics\nBronze Age Collapse\nEuhemerism\nHomeric Question\nMycenae\nMycenaean warfare\nvte\n\n\n^ Attic, Ionic, Homeric and Koine Greek: Ἀπόλλων, romanized: Apóllōn, genitive: Ἀπόλλωνος, romanized: Apóllōnos Attic–Ionic pronunciation: [a.pól.lɔːn], [a.pól.lɔː.nos]; Koine Greek: [aˈpol.lon], [aˈpol.lo.nos]Doric Greek: Ἀπέλλων, romanized: Apéllōn, Doric Greek pronunciation: [a.pel.lɔ̂ːn]; Arcadocypriot Greek:: Ἀπείλων, romanized: Apeílōn, Arcadocypriot Greek: [a.pěː.lɔːn]; Aeolic Greek: Ἄπλουν, romanized: Áploun, Aeolic Greek: [á.ploːn]Latin: Apollō, genitive: Apollinis, Classical Latin: [äˈpɔlːʲoː], [äˈpɔl.lʲɪ.nɪs̠];  Late Latin: [ɑˈpɔl.lɔ], [ɑˈpɔl.li.nis]\n\n^ Mousike (the art of the Muses) was an integral part of life in the ancient Greek world, and the term covered not only music but also dance, lyrics, theatre and the performance of poetry.\n\n\nOnce Apollo and Poseidon served under the Trojan king Laomedon in accordance with Zeus's words. Apollodorus states that the gods willingly went to the king disguised as humans in order to check his hubris.[228] Apollo guarded the cattle of Laomedon in the valleys of Mount Ida, while Poseidon built the walls of Troy.[229] Other versions make both Apollo and Poseidon the builders of the wall. In Ovid's account, Apollo completes his task by playing his tunes on his lyre.[citation needed]\nIn Pindar's odes, the gods took a mortal named Aeacus as their assistant.[230] When the work was completed, three snakes rushed against the wall, and though the two that attacked the sections of the wall built by the gods fell down dead, the third forced its way into the city through the portion of the wall built by Aeacus. Apollo immediately prophesied that Troy would fall at the hands of Aeacus's descendants, the Aeacidae (i.e. his son Telamon joined Heracles when he sieged the city during Laomedon's rule. Later, his great-grandson Neoptolemus was present in the wooden horse that leads to the downfall of Troy).[citation needed]\nHowever, the king not only refused to give the gods the wages he had promised, but also threatened to bind their feet and hands, and sell them as slaves. Angered by the unpaid labour and the insults, Apollo infected the city with a pestilence and Poseidon sent the sea monster Cetus. To deliver the city from it, Laomedon had to sacrifice his daughter Hesione (who would later be saved by Heracles).[citation needed]\nDuring his stay in Troy, Apollo had a lover named Ourea, who was a nymph and daughter of Poseidon. Together they had a son named Ileus, whom Apollo loved dearly.[231]\n\nTrojan War\nThis section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (December 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nApollo sided with the Trojans during the Trojan War waged by the Greeks against the Trojans.\nDuring the war, the Greek king Agamemnon captured Chryseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest Chryses, and refused to return her. Angered by this, Apollo shot arrows infected with the plague into the Greek encampment. He demanded that they return the girl, and the Achaeans (Greeks) complied, indirectly causing the anger of Achilles, which is the theme of the Iliad.\n\nApollo preceding Hector with his aegis, and dispersing the Greeks, by John Flaxman\nReceiving the aegis from Zeus, Apollo entered the battlefield as per his father's command, causing great terror to the enemy with his war cry. He pushed the Greeks back and destroyed many of the soldiers. He is described as \"the rouser of armies\" because he rallied the Trojan army when they were falling apart.\nWhen Zeus allowed the other gods to get involved in the war, Apollo was provoked by Poseidon to a duel. However, Apollo declined to fight him, saying that he would not fight his uncle for the sake of mortals.\n\nApollo preventing Diomedes from pursuing Aeneas\nWhen the Greek hero Diomedes injured the Trojan hero Aeneas, Aphrodite tried to rescue him, but Diomedes injured her as well. Apollo then enveloped Aeneas in a cloud to protect him. He repelled the attacks Diomedes made on him and gave the hero a stern warning to abstain from attacking a god. Aeneas was then taken to Pergamos, a sacred spot in Troy, where he was healed.\nAfter the death of Sarpedon, a son of Zeus, Apollo rescued the corpse from the battlefield as per his father's wish and cleaned it. He then gave it to Sleep (Hypnos) and Death (Thanatos). Apollo had also once convinced Athena to stop the war for that day, so that the warriors can relieve themselves for a while.\n\nApollo protecting Hector's body, by John Flaxman\nThe Trojan hero Hector (who, according to some, was the god's own son by Hecuba[232]) was favored by Apollo. When he got severely injured, Apollo healed him and encouraged him to take up his arms. During a duel with Achilles, when Hector was about to lose, Apollo hid Hector in a cloud of mist to save him. When the Greek warrior Patroclus tried to get into the fort of Troy, he was stopped by Apollo. Encouraging Hector to attack Patroclus, Apollo stripped the armour of the Greek warrior and broke his weapons. Patroclus was eventually killed by Hector. At last, after Hector's fated death, Apollo protected his corpse from Achilles's attempt to mutilate it by creating a magical cloud over the corpse, shielding it from the rays of the sun.\nApollo held a grudge against Achilles throughout the war because Achilles had murdered his son Tenes before the war began and brutally assassinated his son Troilus in his own temple. Not only did Apollo save Hector from Achilles, he also tricked Achilles by disguising himself as a Trojan warrior and driving him away from the gates.\nFinally, Apollo caused Achilles's death by guiding an arrow shot by Paris into Achilles's heel. In some versions, Apollo himself killed Achilles by taking the disguise of Paris.\nApollo helped many Trojan warriors—including Agenor, Polydamas, and Glaucus—in the battlefield. Though he greatly favored the Trojans, Apollo was bound to follow the orders of Zeus and served his father loyally during the war.\n\nNurturer of the young\nApollo Kourotrophos is the god who nurtures and protects children and the young, especially boys. He oversees their education and their passage into adulthood. Education is said to have originated from Apollo and the Muses. Many myths have him train his children. It was a custom for boys to cut and dedicate their long hair to Apollo after reaching adulthood.\nChiron, the abandoned centaur, was fostered by Apollo, who instructed him in medicine, prophecy, archery and more. Chiron would later become a great teacher himself.\nAsclepius in his childhood gained much knowledge pertaining to medicinal arts from his father. However, he was later entrusted to Chiron for further education.\nAnius, Apollo's son by Rhoeo, was abandoned by his mother soon after his birth. Apollo brought him up and educated him in mantic arts. Anius later became the priest of Apollo and the king of Delos.\nIamus was the son of Apollo and Evadne. When Evadne went into labour, Apollo sent the Moirai to assist his lover. After the child was born, Apollo sent snakes to feed the child some honey. When Iamus reached the age of education, Apollo took him to Olympia and taught him many arts, including the ability to understand and explain the languages of birds.[233]\nIdmon was educated by Apollo to be a seer. Even though he foresaw his death that would happen in his journey with the Argonauts, he embraced his destiny and died a brave death. To commemorate his son's bravery, Apollo commanded Boeotians to build a town around the tomb of the hero, and to honor him.[234]\nApollo adopted Carnus, the abandoned son of Zeus and Europa. He reared the child with the help of his mother Leto and educated him to be a seer.\nWhen his son Melaneus reached the age of marriage, Apollo asked the princess Stratonice to be his son's bride and carried her away from her home when she agreed.\nApollo saved a shepherd boy (name unknown) from death in a large deep cave, by means of vultures. To thank him, the shepherd built Apollo a temple under the name Vulturius.[235]\n\nGod of music\nThe music of the spheres. Shown in this engraving from Renaissance Italy are Apollo, the Muses, the planetary spheres and musical ratios.\nApollo, Hyacinth and Cyparissus singing and playing, by Alexander Ivanov 1831–1834\nImmediately after his birth, Apollo demanded a lyre and invented the paean, thus becoming the god of music. As the divine singer, he is the patron of poets, singers and musicians. The invention of string music is attributed to him. Plato said that the innate ability of humans to take delight in music, rhythm and harmony is the gift of Apollo and the Muses.[236] According to Socrates, ancient Greeks believed that Apollo is the god who directs the harmony and makes all things move together, both for the gods and the humans. For this reason, he was called Homopolon before the Homo was replaced by A.[237][238] Apollo's harmonious music delivered people from their pain, and hence, like Dionysus, he is also called the liberator.[162] The swans, which were considered to be the most musical among the birds, were believed to be the \"singers of Apollo\". They are Apollo's sacred birds and acted as his vehicle during his travel to Hyperborea.[162] Aelian says that when the singers would sing hymns to Apollo, the swans would join the chant in unison.[239]\n\nApollo and the Muses on Parnassus, by Andrea Appiani\nAmong the Pythagoreans, the study of mathematics and music were connected to the worship of Apollo, their principal deity.[240][241][242] Their belief was that music purifies the soul, just as medicine purifies the body. They also believed that music was delegated to the same mathematical laws of harmony as the mechanics of the cosmos, evolving into an idea known as the music of the spheres.[243]\nApollo appears as the companion of the Muses, and as Musagetes (\"leader of Muses\") he leads them in dance. They spend their time on Parnassus, which is one of their sacred places. Apollo is also the lover of the Muses and by them he became the father of famous musicians like Orpheus and Linus.[citation needed]\nApollo is often found delighting the immortal gods with his songs and music on the lyre.[244] In his role as the god of banquets, he was always present to play music at weddings of the gods, like the marriage of Eros and Psyche, Peleus and Thetis. He is a frequent guest of the Bacchanalia, and many ancient ceramics depict him being at ease amidst the maenads and satyrs.[245] Apollo also participated in musical contests when challenged by others. He was the victor in all those contests, but he tended to punish his opponents severely for their hubris.[citation needed]\n\nApollo's lyre\nDetail of Apollo's lyre\nThe invention of the lyre is attributed either to Hermes or to Apollo himself.[246] Distinctions have been made that Hermes invented lyre made of tortoise shell, whereas the lyre Apollo invented was a regular lyre.[247]\nMyths tell that the infant Hermes stole a number of Apollo's cows and took them to a cave in the woods near Pylos, covering their tracks. In the cave, he found a tortoise and killed it, then removed the insides. He used one of the cow's intestines and the tortoise shell and made his lyre.[citation needed]\n\nThe friendship of Apollo and Hermes, by Noël Coypel\nUpon discovering the theft, Apollo confronted Hermes and asked him to return his cattle. When Hermes acted innocent, Apollo took the matter to Zeus. Zeus, having seen the events, sided with Apollo, and ordered Hermes to return the cattle.[248] Hermes then began to play music on the lyre he had invented. Apollo fell in love with the instrument and offered to exchange the cattle for the lyre. Hence, Apollo then became the master of the lyre.[citation needed]\nAccording to other versions, Apollo had invented the lyre himself, whose strings he tore in repenting of the excess punishment he had given to Marsyas. Hermes's lyre, therefore, would be a reinvention.[249]\n\nContest with Pan\nThe musical duel of Pan and Apollo, by Laurits Tuxen\nOnce Pan had the audacity to compare his music with that of Apollo and to challenge the god of music to a contest. The mountain-god Tmolus was chosen to umpire. Pan blew on his pipes, and with his rustic melody gave great satisfaction to himself and his faithful follower, Midas, who happened to be present. Then, Apollo struck the strings of his lyre. It was so beautiful that Tmolus at once awarded the victory to Apollo, and everyone was pleased with the judgement. Only Midas dissented and questioned the justice of the award. Apollo did not want to suffer such a depraved pair of ears any longer, and caused them to become the ears of a donkey.[citation needed]\n\nContest with Marsyas\nMarsyas was a satyr who was punished by Apollo for his hubris. He had found an aulos on the ground, tossed away after being invented by Athena because it made her cheeks puffy. Athena had also placed a curse upon the instrument, that whoever would pick it up would be severely punished. When Marsyas played the flute, everyone became frenzied with joy. This led Marsyas to think that he was better than Apollo, and he challenged the god to a musical contest. The contest was judged by the Muses, or the nymphs of Nysa. Athena was also present to witness the contest.[citation needed]\nMarsyas taunted Apollo for \"wearing his hair long, for having a fair face and smooth body, for his skill in so many arts\".[250] He also further said,\n\n'His [Apollo] hair is smooth and made into tufts and curls that fall about his brow and hang before his face. His body is fair from head to foot, his limbs shine bright, his tongue gives oracles, and he is equally eloquent in prose or verse, propose which you will. What of his robes so fine in texture, so soft to the touch, aglow with purple? What of his lyre that flashes gold, gleams white with ivory, and shimmers with rainbow gems? What of his song, so cunning and so sweet? Nay, all these allurements suit with naught save luxury. To virtue they bring shame alone!'[250]\nThe Muses and Athena sniggered at this comment. The contestants agreed to take turns displaying their skills and the rule was that the victor could \"do whatever he wanted\" to the loser.[citation needed]\n\nThe contest between Apollo and Marsyas, by Palma il Giovane\nAccording to one account, after the first round, they both were deemed equal by the Nysiads. But in the next round, Apollo decided to play on his lyre and add his melodious voice to his performance. Marsyas argued against this, saying that Apollo would have an advantage and accused Apollo of cheating. But Apollo replied that since Marsyas played the flute, which needed air blown from the throat, it was similar to singing, and that either they both should get an equal chance to combine their skills or none of them should use their mouths at all. The nymphs decided that Apollo's argument was just. Apollo then played his lyre and sang at the same time, mesmerising the audience. Marsyas could not do this. Apollo was declared the winner and, angered with Marsyas's haughtiness and his accusations, decided to flay the satyr.[251]\n\nMarsyas flayed by the order of Apollo, by Charles-André van Loo\nAccording to another account, Marsyas played his flute out of tune at one point and accepted his defeat. Out of shame, he assigned to himself the punishment of being skinned for a wine sack.[252] Another variation is that Apollo played his instrument upside down. Marsyas could not do this with his instrument. So the Muses who were the judges declared Apollo the winner. Apollo hung Marsyas from a tree to flay him.[253]\nApollo flayed the limbs of Marsyas alive in a cave near Celaenae in Phrygia for his hubris to challenge a god. He then gave the rest of his body for proper burial[254] and nailed Marsyas's flayed skin to a nearby pine-tree as a lesson to the others. Marsyas's blood turned into the river Marsyas. But Apollo soon repented and being distressed at what he had done, he tore the strings of his lyre and threw it away. The lyre was later discovered by the Muses and Apollo's sons Linus and Orpheus. The Muses fixed the middle string, Linus the string struck with the forefinger, and Orpheus the lowest string and the one next to it. They took it back to Apollo, but the god, who had decided to stay away from music for a while, laid away both the lyre and the pipes at Delphi and joined Cybele in her wanderings to as far as Hyperborea.[251][255]\n\nContest with Cinyras\nCinyras was a ruler of Cyprus, who was a friend of Agamemnon. Cinyras promised to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan war, but did not keep his promise. Agamemnon cursed Cinyras. He invoked Apollo and asked the god to avenge the broken promise. Apollo then had a lyre-playing contest with Cinyras, and defeated him. Either Cinyras committed suicide when he lost, or was killed by Apollo.[256][257]\n\nApollon Raon, Versailles\nPatron of sailors\nApollo functions as the patron and protector of sailors, one of the duties he shares with Poseidon. In the myths, he is seen helping heroes who pray to him for a safe journey.[citation needed]\nWhen Apollo spotted a ship of Cretan sailors that were caught in a storm, he quickly assumed the shape of a dolphin and guided their ship safely to Delphi.[258]\nWhen the Argonauts faced a terrible storm, Jason prayed to his patron, Apollo, to help them. Apollo used his bow and golden arrow to shed light upon an island, where the Argonauts soon took shelter. This island was renamed \"Anaphe\", which means \"He revealed it\".[259]\nApollo helped the Greek hero Diomedes, to escape from a great tempest during his journey homeward. As a token of gratitude, Diomedes built a temple in honor of Apollo under the epithet Epibaterius (\"the embarker\").[260]\nDuring the Trojan War, Odysseus came to the Trojan camp to return Chriseis, the daughter of Apollo's priest Chryses, and brought many offerings to Apollo. Pleased with this, Apollo sent gentle breezes that helped Odysseus return safely to the Greek camp.[261]\nArion was a poet who was kidnapped by some sailors for the rich prizes he possessed. Arion requested them to let him sing for the last time, to which the sailors consented. Arion began singing a song in praise of Apollo, seeking the god's help. Consequently, numerous dolphins surrounded the ship and when Arion jumped into the water, the dolphins carried him away safely.[citation needed]\n\nWars\nTrojan War\nApollo played a pivotal role in the entire Trojan War. He sided with the Trojans, and sent a terrible plague to the Greek camp, which indirectly led to the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon. He killed the Greek heroes Patroclus, Achilles, and numerous Greek soldiers. He also helped many Trojan heroes, the most important one being Hector. After the end of the war, Apollo and Poseidon together cleaned the remains of the city and the camps.[citation needed]\n\nParis (on the left) putting on his armour as Apollo (on the right) watches him. Attic red-figure kantharos, 425–420 BC\nTelegony war\nA war broke out between the Brygoi and the Thesprotians, who had the support of Odysseus. The gods Athena and Ares came to the battlefield and took sides. Athena helped the hero Odysseus while Ares fought alongside of the Brygoi. When Odysseus lost, Athena and Ares came into a direct duel. To stop the battling gods and the terror created by their battle, Apollo intervened and stopped the duel between them.[262][263]\n\nIndian war\nWhen Zeus suggested that Dionysus defeat the Indians in order to earn a place among the gods, Dionysus declared war against the Indians and travelled to India along with his army of Bacchantes and satyrs. Among the warriors was Aristaeus, Apollo's son. Apollo armed his son with his own hands and gave him a bow and arrows and fitted a strong shield to his arm.[264] After Zeus urged Apollo to join the war, he went to the battlefield.[265] Seeing several of his nymphs and Aristaeus drowning in a river, he took them to safety and healed them.[266] He taught Aristaeus more useful healing arts and sent him back to help the army of Dionysus.[citation needed]\n\nTheban war\nDuring the war between the sons of Oedipus, Apollo favored Amphiaraus, a seer and one of the leaders in the war. Though saddened that the seer was fated to be doomed in the war, Apollo made Amphiaraus's last hours glorious by \"lighting his shield and his helm with starry gleam\". When Hypseus tried to kill the hero with a spear, Apollo directed the spear towards the charioteer of Amphiaraus instead. Then Apollo himself replaced the charioteer and took the reins in his hands. He deflected many spears and arrows away from them. He also killed many of the enemy warriors like Melaneus, Antiphus, Aetion, Polites and Lampus. At last, when the moment of departure came, Apollo expressed his grief with tears in his eyes and bid farewell to Amphiaraus, who was soon engulfed by the Earth.[267]\n\nSlaying of giants\nApollo killed the giants Python and Tityos, who had assaulted his mother Leto.[citation needed]\n\nGigantomachy\nDuring the gigantomachy, Apollo and Heracles blinded the giant Ephialtes by shooting him in his eyes, Apollo shooting his left and Heracles his right.[268] He also killed Porphyrion, the king of giants, using his bow and arrows.[269]\n\nAloadae\nThe Aloadae, namely Otis and Ephialtes, were twin giants who decided to wage war upon the gods. They attempted to storm Mt. Olympus by piling up mountains, and threatened to fill the sea with mountains and inundate dry land.[270] They even dared to seek the hand of Hera and Artemis in marriage. Angered by this, Apollo killed them by shooting them with arrows.[271] According to another tale, Apollo killed them by sending a deer between them; as they tried to kill it with their javelins, they accidentally stabbed each other and died.[272]\n\nPhorbas\nPhorbas was a savage giant king of Phlegyas who was described as having swine-like features. He wished to plunder Delphi for its wealth. He seized the roads to Delphi and started harassing the pilgrims. He captured the old people and children and sent them to his army to hold them for ransom. And he challenged the young and sturdy men to a match of boxing, only to cut their heads off when they would get defeated by him. He hung the chopped-off heads to an oak tree. Finally, Apollo came to put an end to this cruelty. He entered a boxing contest with Phorbas and killed him with a single blow.[273]\n\nOther stories\nApollo as the rising sun, by François Boucher\nIn the first Olympic games, Apollo defeated Ares and became the victor in wrestling. He outran Hermes in the race and won first place.[274]\nApollo divides months into summer and winter.[275] He rides on the back of a swan to the land of the Hyperboreans during the winter months, and the absence of warmth in winter is due to his departure. During his absence, Delphi was under the care of Dionysus, and no prophecies were given during winters.[citation needed]\n\nPeriphas\nPeriphas was an Attican king and a priest of Apollo. He was noble, just and rich. He did all his duties justly. Because of this people were very fond of him and started honouring him to the same extent as Zeus. At one point, they worshipped Periphas in place of Zeus and set up shrines and temples for him. This annoyed Zeus, who decided to annihilate the entire family of Periphas. But because he was a just king and a good devotee, Apollo intervened and requested his father to spare Periphas. Zeus considered Apollo's words and agreed to let him live. But he metamorphosed Periphas into an eagle and made the eagle the king of birds. When Periphas's wife Phene requested Zeus to let her stay with her husband, Zeus turned her into a vulture and fulfilled her wish.[276]\n\nMolpadia and Parthenos\nMolpadia and Parthenos were the sisters of Rhoeo, a former lover of Apollo. One day, they were put in charge of watching their father's ancestral wine jar but they fell asleep while performing this duty. While they were asleep, the wine jar was broken by the swine their family kept. When the sisters woke up and saw what had happened, they threw themselves off a cliff in fear of their father's wrath. Apollo, who was passing by, caught them and carried them to two different cities in Chersonesus, Molpadia to Castabus and Parthenos to Bubastus. He turned them into goddesses and they both received divine honors. Molpadia's name was changed to Hemithea upon her deification.[277]\n\nPrometheus\nPrometheus was the titan who was punished by Zeus for stealing fire. He was bound to a rock, where each day an eagle was sent to eat Prometheus's liver, which would then grow back overnight to be eaten again the next day. Seeing his plight, Apollo pleaded with Zeus to release the kind Titan, while Artemis and Leto stood behind him with tears in their eyes. Zeus, moved by Apollo's words and the tears of the goddesses, finally sent Heracles to free Prometheus.[278]\n\nApollo crowning the arts, by Nicolas-Guy Brenet\nHeracles\nAfter Heracles (then named Alcides) was struck with madness and killed his family, he sought to purify himself and consulted the oracle of Apollo. Apollo, through the Pythia, commanded him to serve king Eurystheus for twelve years and complete the ten tasks the king would give him. Only then would Alcides be absolved of his sin. Apollo also renamed him Heracles.[279]\n\nHeracles and Apollo struggling over the hind, as depicted on a Corinthian helmet (early 5th century BC)\nTo complete his third task, Heracles had to capture the Ceryneian Hind, a hind sacred to Artemis, and bring back it alive. After chasing the hind for one year, the animal eventually got tired, and when it tried crossing the river Ladon, Heracles captured it. While he was taking it back, he was confronted by Apollo and Artemis, who were angered at Heracles for this act. However, Heracles soothed the goddess and explained his situation to her. After much pleading, Artemis permitted him to take the hind and told him to return it later.[280]\nAfter he was freed from his servitude to Eurystheus, Heracles fell in conflict with Iphytus, a prince of Oechalia, and murdered him. Soon after, he contracted a terrible disease. He consulted the oracle of Apollo once again, in the hope of ridding himself of the disease. The Pythia, however, denied to give any prophesy. In anger, Heracles snatched the sacred tripod and started walking away, intending to start his own oracle. However, Apollo did not tolerate this and stopped Heracles; a duel ensued between them. Artemis rushed to support Apollo, while Athena supported Heracles. Soon, Zeus threw his thunderbolt between the fighting brothers and separated them. He reprimanded Heracles for this act of violation and asked Apollo to give a solution to Heracles. Apollo then ordered the hero to serve under Omphale, queen of Lydia for one year in order to purify himself.[citation needed]\nAfter their reconciliation, Apollo and Heracles together founded the city of Gythion.[281]\n\nThe rock of Leukas\nLeukatas was believed to be a white-colored rock jutting out from the island of Leukas into the sea. It was present in the sanctuary of Apollo Leukates. A leap from this rock was believed to have put an end to the longings of love.[282]\nOnce, Aphrodite fell deeply in love with Adonis, a young man of great beauty who was later accidentally killed by a boar. Heartbroken, Aphrodite wandered looking for the rock of Leukas. When she reached the sanctuary of Apollo in Argos, she confided in him her love and sorrow. Apollo then brought her to the rock of Leukas and asked her to throw herself from the top of the rock. She did so and was freed from her love. When she sought the reason behind this, Apollo told her that Zeus, before taking another lover, would sit on this rock to free himself from his love for Hera.[213]\nAnother tale relates that a man named Nireus, who fell in love with the cult statue of Athena, came to the rock and jumped in order to relieve himself. After jumping, he fell into the net of a fisherman in which, when he was pulled out, he found a box filled with gold. He fought with the fisherman and took the gold, but Apollo appeared to him in the night in a dream and warned him not to appropriate gold which belonged to others.[213]\nIt was an ancestral custom among the Leukadians to fling a criminal from this rock every year at the sacrifice performed in honor of Apollo for the sake of averting evil. However, a number of men would be stationed all around below rock to catch the criminal and take him out of the borders in order to exile him from the island.[283][213] This was the same rock from which, according to a legend, Sappho took her suicidal leap.[282]\n\nApollo as the setting sun, by François Boucher\nSlaying of Titans\nOnce Hera, out of spite, aroused the Titans to war against Zeus and take away his throne. Accordingly, when the Titans tried to climb Mount Olympus, Zeus with the help of Apollo, Artemis and Athena, defeated them and cast them into Tartarus.[284]\n\nFemale lovers\nApollo and the Muses, by Robert Sanderson\nApollo, God of Light, Eloquence, Poetry and the Fine Arts with Urania, Muse of Astronomy (1798) by Charles Meynier \nApollo is said to have been the lover of all nine Muses, and not being able to choose one of them, he decided to remain unwed. He fathered the Corybantes by the Muse Thalia.[285] By Calliope, he had Hymenaios, Ialemus, Orpheus[286] and Linus. Alternatively, Linus was said to be the son of Apollo and either Urania or Terpsichore.[citation needed]\nIn the Great Eoiae that is attributed to Hesiod, Scylla is the daughter of Apollo and Hecate.[287]\nCyrene was a Thessalian princess whom Apollo loved. In her honor, he built the city Cyrene and made her its ruler. She was later granted longevity by Apollo who turned her into a nymph. The couple had two sons, Aristaeus, and Idmon.[citation needed]\nEvadne was a nymph daughter of Poseidon and a lover of Apollo. They had a son, Iamos. During the time of the childbirth, Apollo sent Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth to assist her.\nRhoeo, a princess of the island of Naxos was loved by Apollo. Out of affection for her, Apollo turned her sisters into goddesses. On the island Delos she bore Apollo a son named Anius. Not wanting to have the child, she entrusted the infant to Apollo and left. Apollo raised and educated the child on his own.[citation needed]\nOurea, a daughter of Poseidon, fell in love with Apollo when he and Poseidon were serving the Trojan king Laomedon. They both united on the day the walls of Troy were built. She bore to Apollo a son, whom Apollo named Ileus, after the city of his birth, Ilion (Troy). Ileus was very dear to Apollo.[288]\nThero, daughter of Phylas, a maiden as beautiful as the moonbeams, was loved by the radiant Apollo, and she loved him in return. Through their union, she became the mother of Chaeron, who was famed as \"the tamer of horses\". He later built the city Chaeronea.[289]\nHyrie or Thyrie was the mother of Cycnus. Apollo turned both the mother and son into swans when they jumped into a lake and tried to kill themselves.[290]\nHecuba was the wife of King Priam of Troy, and Apollo had a son with her named Troilus. An oracle prophesied that Troy would not be defeated as long as Troilus reached the age of twenty alive. He was ambushed and killed by Achilleus, and Apollo avenged his death by killing Achilles. After the sack of Troy, Hecuba was taken to Lycia by Apollo.[291]\nCoronis was daughter of Phlegyas, King of the Lapiths. While pregnant with Asclepius, Coronis fell in love with Ischys, son of Elatus and slept with him. When Apollo found out about her infidelity through his prophetic powers or thanks to his raven who informed him, he sent his sister, Artemis, to kill Coronis. Apollo rescued the baby by cutting open Coronis's belly and gave it to the centaur Chiron to raise.[citation needed]\nDryope, the daughter of Dryops, was impregnated by Apollo in the form of a snake. She gave birth to a son named Amphissus.[292]\nIn Euripides's play Ion, Apollo fathered Ion by Creusa, wife of Xuthus. He used his powers to conceal her pregnancy from her father. Later, when Creusa left Ion to die in the wild, Apollo asked Hermes to save the child and bring him to the oracle at Delphi, where he was raised by a priestess.[citation needed]\nApollo loved and kidnapped an Oceanid nymph, Melia. Her father Oceanus sent one of his sons, Caanthus, to find her, but Caanthus could not take her back from Apollo, so he burned Apollo's sanctuary. In retaliation, Apollo shot and killed Caanthus.[293]\n\nMale lovers\nDeath of Hyacinth, by Alexander Kiselyov, 1850–1900\nHyacinth (or Hyacinthus), a beautiful and athletic Spartan prince, was one of Apollo's favourite lovers.[294] The pair was practicing throwing the discus when a discus thrown by Apollo was blown off course by the jealous Zephyrus and struck Hyacinthus in the head, killing him instantly. Apollo is said to be filled with grief. Out of Hyacinthus's blood, Apollo created a flower named after him as a memorial to his death, and his tears stained the flower petals with the interjection αἰαῖ, meaning alas.[295] He was later resurrected and taken to heaven. The festival Hyacinthia was a national celebration of Sparta, which commemorated the death and rebirth of Hyacinthus.[296]\nAnother male lover was Cyparissus, a descendant of Heracles. Apollo gave him a tame deer as a companion but Cyparissus accidentally killed it with a javelin as it lay asleep in the undergrowth. Cyparissus was so saddened by its death that he asked Apollo to let his tears fall forever. Apollo granted the request by turning him into the Cypress named after him, which was said to be a sad tree because the sap forms droplets like tears on the trunk.[297]\n\nApollo and Cyparissus, by Jean-Pierre Granger (1779–1840)\nAdmetus, the king of Pherae, was also Apollo's lover.[298][299] During his exile, which lasted either for one year or nine years,[300] Apollo served Admetus as a herdsman. The romantic nature of their relationship was first described by Callimachus of Alexandria, who wrote that Apollo was \"fired with love\" for Admetus.[162] Plutarch lists Admetus as one of Apollo's lovers and says that Apollo served Admetus because he doted upon him.[301] Latin poet Ovid in his Ars Amatoria said that even though he was a god, Apollo forsook his pride and stayed in as a servant for the sake of Admetus.[302] Tibullus describes Apollo's love to the king as servitium amoris (slavery of love) and asserts that Apollo became his servant not by force but by choice. He would also make cheese and serve it to Admetus. His domestic actions caused embarrassment to his family.[303]\n\nApollo visiting Admetus, by Nicolas-Antoine Taunay, 19th century\n Oh how often his sister (Diana) blushed at meeting her brother as he carried a young calf through the fields!....often Latona lamented when she saw her son's disheveled locks which were admired even by Juno, his step-mother...[304]\nWhen Admetus wanted to marry princess Alcestis, Apollo provided a chariot pulled by a lion and a boar he had tamed. This satisfied Alcestis's father and he let Admetus marry his daughter. Further, Apollo saved the king from Artemis's wrath and also convinced the Moirai to postpone Admetus's death once.[citation needed]\nBranchus, a shepherd, one day came across Apollo in the woods. Captivated by the god's beauty, he kissed Apollo. Apollo requited his affections and wanting to reward him, bestowed prophetic skills on him. His descendants, the Branchides, were an influential clan of prophets.[305]\nOther male lovers of Apollo include:\n\nAdonis, who is said to have been the lover of both Apollo and Aphrodite. He behaved as a man with Aphrodite and as a woman with Apollo.[306]\nAtymnius,[307] otherwise known as a beloved of Sarpedon\nBoreas, the god of North winds[308]\nCinyras, king of Cyprus and the priest of Aphrodite[309]\nHelenus, a Trojan prince (son of Priam and Hecuba). He received from Apollo an ivory bow with which he later wounded Achilles in the hand.[310]\nHippolytus of Sicyon (not the same as Hippolytus, the son of Theseus)[299]\nHymenaios, the son of Magnes[311]\nIapis, to whom Apollo taught the art of healing[312]\nPhorbas, the dragon slayer (probably the son of Triopas)[313]\nChildren\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

His children grew up to be physicians, musicians, poets, seers or archers. Many of his sons founded new cities and became kings.\n\nApollo entrusting Chiron with the education of Aescalapius\nAsclepius is the most famous son of Apollo. His skills as a physician surpassed that of Apollo's. Zeus killed him for bringing back the dead, but upon Apollo's request, he was resurrected as a god. Aristaeus was placed under the care of Chiron after his birth. He became the god of beekeeping, cheese-making, animal husbandry and more. He was ultimately given immortality for the benefits he bestowed upon humanity. The Corybantes were spear-clashing, dancing demigods.\nThe sons of Apollo who participated in the Trojan War include the Trojan princes Hector and Troilus, as well as Tenes, the king of Tenedos, all three of whom were killed by Achilles over the course of the war.\nApollo's children who became musicians and bards include Orpheus, Linus, Ialemus, Hymenaeus, Philammon, Eumolpus and Eleuther. Apollo fathered 3 daughters, Apollonis, Borysthenis and Cephisso, who formed a group of minor Muses, the \"Musa Apollonides\".[314] Plutarch recounts that the Delphians believed the three Muses to be Nete, Mese, and Hypate, after the highest, middle, and lowest strings of the lyre.[315] Phemonoe was a seer and poet who was the inventor of Hexameter.\nApis, Idmon, Iamus, Tenerus, Mopsus, Galeus, Telmessus and others were gifted seers. Anius, Pythaeus and Ismenus lived as high priests. Most of them were trained by Apollo himself.\nArabus, Delphos, Dryops, Miletos, Tenes, Epidaurus, Ceos, Lycoras, Syrus, Pisus, Marathus, Megarus, Patarus, Acraepheus, Cicon, Chaeron and many other sons of Apollo, under the guidance of his words, founded eponymous cities.\nHe also had a son by Agathippe who was named Chrysorrhoas who was a mechanic artist.[316] His other daughters include Eurynome, Chariclo wife of Chiron, Eurydice the wife of Orpheus, Eriopis, famous for her beautiful hair, Melite the heroine, Pamphile the silk weaver, Parthenos, and by some accounts, Phoebe, Hilyra and Scylla. Apollo turned Parthenos into a constellation after her early death.\nAdditionally, Apollo fostered and educated Chiron, the centaur who later became the greatest teacher and educated many demigods, including Apollo's sons. Apollo also fostered Carnus, the son of Zeus and Europa.\n\nList of offspring and their mothers\nThe following is a list of Apollo's offspring, by various mothers.

When Apollo chased her in order to persuade her, she changed herself into a laurel tree. According to other versions, she cried for help during the chase, and Gaia helped her by taking her in and placing a laurel tree in her place.[393] According to Roman poet Ovid, the chase was brought about by Cupid, who hit Apollo with a golden arrow of love and Daphne with a leaden arrow of hatred.[394] The myth explains the origin of the laurel and the connection of Apollo with the laurel and its leaves, which his priestess employed at Delphi. The leaves became the symbol of victory and laurel wreaths were given to the victors of the Pythian games.[citation needed]\nMarpessa was kidnapped by Idas but was loved by Apollo as well. Zeus made her choose between them, and she chose Idas on the grounds that Apollo, being immortal, would tire of her when she grew old.[395]\nSinope, a nymph, was approached by the amorous Apollo. She made him promise that he would grant to her whatever she would ask for, and then cleverly asked him to let her stay a virgin. Apollo kept his promise and went back.[citation needed]\nBolina was admired by Apollo but she refused him and jumped into the sea. To avoid her death, Apollo turned her into a nymph, saving her life.[396]\nCastalia was a nymph whom Apollo loved. She fled from him and dove into the spring at Delphi, at the base of Mt. Parnassos, which was then named after her. Water from this spring was sacred; it was used to clean the Delphian temples and inspire the priestesses.[397]\nCassandra was a daughter of Hecuba and Priam. Apollo wished to court her. Cassandra promised to return his love on one condition – he should give her the power to see the future. Apollo fulfilled her wish, but she went back on her word and rejected him soon after. Angered that she broke her promise, Apollo cursed her that even though she would see the future, no one would ever believe her prophecies.[citation needed]\nThe Sibyl of Cumae like Cassandra promised Apollo her love in exchange for a boon. asking for as many years of life as the grains of sand in her hand. Apollo granted her wish, but she broke her word. While she lived longer, Apollo did not grant her agelessness, causing her to wither until only her voice remained.[398]\nHestia, the goddess of the hearth, rejected both Apollo's and Poseidon's marriage proposals and swore that she would always stay unmarried.[citation needed]\nIn one version of the prophet Tiresias's origins, he was originally a woman who promised Apollo to sleep with him if he would give her music lessons. Apollo gave her her wish, but then she went back on her word and refused him. Apollo in anger turned her into a man.[399]\n\nFemale counterparts\nApollo and Artemis, by Gavin Hamilton\nArtemis\nApollo (left) and Artemis, by Brygos (potter signed). Tondo of an Attic red-figure cup c. 470 BC, Musée du Louvre.\nArtemis as the sister of Apollo, is thea apollousa, that is, she as a female divinity represented the same idea that Apollo did as a male divinity. In the pre-Hellenic period, their relationship was described as the one between husband and wife, and there seems to have been a tradition which actually described Artemis as the wife of Apollo.[citation needed] However, this relationship was never sexual but spiritual,[400] which is why they both are seen being unmarried in the Hellenic period.[citation needed]\nArtemis, like her brother, is armed with a bow and arrows. She is the cause of sudden deaths of women. She also is the protector of the young, especially girls. Though she has nothing to do with oracles, music or poetry, she sometimes led the female chorus on Olympus while Apollo sang.[401] The laurel (daphne in Greek) was sacred to both. Artemis Daphnaia had her temple among the Lacedemonians, at a place called Hypsoi.[402] Apollo Daphnephoros had a temple in Eretria, a \"place where the citizens are to take the oaths\".[403] In later times when Apollo was regarded as identical with the sun or Helios, Artemis was naturally regarded as Selene or the moon.[citation needed]\n\nHecate\nHecate: procession to witches' sabbath, by Jusepe de Ribera\nHecate, the goddess of witchcraft and magic, is the chthonic counterpart of Apollo. They both are cousins, since their mothers – Leto and Asteria – are sisters. One of Apollo's epithets, Hecatos, is the masculine form of Hecate, and both names mean \"working from afar\". While Apollo presided over the prophetic powers and magic of light and heaven, Hecate presided over the prophetic powers and magic of night and chthonian darkness.[citation needed] If Hecate is the \"gate-keeper\", Apollo Agyieus is the \"door-keeper\". Hecate is the goddess of crossroads and Apollo is the god and protector of streets.[404]\n\nPallas Athena visiting Apollo on Parnassus, by Arnold Houbraken\nThe oldest evidence found for Hecate's worship is at Apollo's temple in Miletos. There, Hecate was taken to be Apollo's sister counterpart in the absence of Artemis.[404] Hecate's lunar nature makes her the goddess of the waning moon and contrasts and complements, at the same time, Apollo's solar nature.[citation needed]\n\nAthena\nAs a deity of knowledge and great power, Apollo was seen being the male counterpart of Athena. Being Zeus's favorite children, they were given more powers and duties. Apollo and Athena often took up the role of protectors of cities, and were patrons of some of the important cities. Athena was the principal goddess of Athens, Apollo was the principal god of Sparta.[405]\nAs patrons of arts, Apollo and Athena were companions of the Muses, the former a much more frequent companion than the latter.[406] Apollo was sometimes called the son of Athena and Hephaestus.[407]\nIn the Trojan War, as Zeus's executive, Apollo is seen holding the aegis like Athena usually does.[408] Apollo's decisions were usually approved by his sister Athena, and they both worked to establish the law and order set forth by Zeus.[409]\n\nRoman Apollo\nThe Roman worship of Apollo was adopted from the Greeks.[410] As a quintessentially Greek god, Apollo had no direct Roman equivalent, although later Roman poets often referred to him as Phoebus.[citation needed] There was a tradition that the Delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the kings of Rome during the reign of Tarquinius Superbus.[411]\nOn the occasion of a pestilence in the 430s BCE, Apollo's first temple at Rome was established in the Flaminian fields, replacing an older cult site there known as the \"Apollinare\".[412] During the Second Punic War in 212 BCE, the Ludi Apollinares (\"Apollonian Games\") were instituted in his honor, on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one Marcius.[413] In the time of Augustus, who considered himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said to be his son, his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of Rome.[414][410]\nAfter the Battle of Actium, which was fought near a sanctuary of Apollo, Augustus enlarged Apollo's temple, dedicated a portion of the spoils to him, and instituted quinquennial games in his honour.[415] He also erected a new temple to the god on the Palatine hill.[416] Sacrifices and prayers on the Palatine to Apollo and Diana formed the culmination of the Secular Games, held in 17 BCE to celebrate the dawn of a new era.[417]\n\nFestivals\nThe chief Apollonian festival was the Pythian Games held every four years at Delphi and was one of the four great Panhellenic Games. Also of major importance was the Delia held every four years on Delos. Athenian annual festivals included the Boedromia, Metageitnia,[418] Pyanepsia, and Thargelia.\nSpartan annual festivals were the Carneia and the Hyacinthia.\nThebes every nine years held the Daphnephoria.[citation needed]\n\nAttributes and symbols\nApollo's most common attributes were the bow and arrow. Other attributes of his included the kithara (an advanced version of the common lyre), the plectrum and the sword. Another common emblem was the sacrificial tripod, representing his prophetic powers. The Pythian Games were held in Apollo's honor every four years at Delphi. The bay laurel plant was used in expiatory sacrifices and in making the crown of victory at these games.[410]\n\nGold stater of the Seleucid king Antiochus I Soter (reigned 281–261 BCE), showing on the reverse a nude Apollo holding his key attributes: two arrows and a bow\nThe palm tree was also sacred to Apollo because he had been born under one in Delos. Animals sacred to Apollo included wolves, dolphins, roe deer, swans, cicadas (symbolizing music and song), ravens, hawks, crows (Apollo had hawks and crows as his messengers),[419] snakes (referencing Apollo's function as the god of prophecy), mice and griffins, mythical eagle–lion hybrids of Eastern origin.[410]\nHomer and Porphyry wrote that Apollo had a hawk as his messenger.[420][419] In many myths Apollo is transformed into a hawk.[421][422][423] In addition, Claudius Aelianus wrote that in Ancient Egypt people believed that hawks were sacred to the god[424] and that according to the ministers of Apollo in Egypt there were certain men called \"hawk-keepers\" (ἱερακοβοσκοί) who fed and tended the hawks belonging to the god.[425] Eusebius wrote that the second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo in Egypt and that the city's symbol is a man with a hawklike face (Horus).[426] Claudius Aelianus wrote that Egyptians called Apollo Horus in their own language.[424]\n\nApollo Citharoedus (\"Apollo with a kithara\"), Musei Capitolini, Rome\nAs god of colonization,[427] Apollo gave oracular guidance on colonies, especially during the height of colonization, 750–550 BCE. According to Greek tradition, he helped Cretan or Arcadian colonists found the city of Troy. However, this story may reflect a cultural influence which had the reverse direction: Hittite cuneiform texts mention an Asia Minor god called Appaliunas or Apalunas in connection with the city of Wilusa attested in Hittite inscriptions, which is now generally regarded as being identical with the Greek Ilion by most scholars. In this interpretation, Apollo's title of Lykegenes can simply be read as \"born in Lycia\", which effectively severs the god's supposed link with wolves (possibly a folk etymology).[428]\nIn literary contexts, Apollo represents harmony, order, and reason—characteristics contrasted with those of Dionysus, god of wine, who represents ecstasy and disorder. The contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives Apollonian and Dionysian. However, the Greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary: the two gods are brothers, and when Apollo at winter left for Hyperborea, he would leave the Delphic oracle to Dionysus. This contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the Borghese Vase.[citation needed]\nApollo is often associated with the Golden Mean. This is the Greek ideal of moderation and a virtue that opposes gluttony.[citation needed]\nIn antiquity, Apollo was associated with the planet Mercury. The ancient Greeks believed that the Mercury as observed during the morning was different from the one during the evening, because each twilight Mercury would appear farther from the Sun as it set than it had the night before. The morning planet was called Apollo, and the one at evening Hermes/Mercury before they realised they were the same, thereupon the name 'Mercury/Hermes' was kept, and 'Apollo' was dropped.[1]\n\nApollo in the arts\nApollo is a common theme in Greek and Roman art and also in the art of the Renaissance. The earliest Greek word for a statue is \"delight\" (ἄγαλμα, agalma), and the sculptors tried to create forms which would inspire such guiding vision. Maurice Bowra notices that the Greek artist puts into a god the highest degree of power and beauty that can be imagined. The sculptors derived this from observations on human beings, but they also embodied in concrete form, issues beyond the reach of ordinary thought.[429]\nThe naked bodies of the statues are associated with the cult of the body which was essentially a religious activity.[430] The muscular frames and limbs combined with slim waists indicate the Greek desire for health, and the physical capacity which was necessary in the hard Greek environment.[431] The statues of Apollo and the other gods present them in their full youth and strength. \"In the balance and relation of their limbs, such figures express their whole character, mental and physical, and reveal their central being, the radiant reality of youth in its heyday\".[432]\n\nArchaic sculpture\nNumerous statues of male youths from Archaic Greece exist, and were once thought to be representations of Apollo, though later discoveries indicated that many represented mortals.[433] In 1895, V. I. Leonardos proposed the term kouros (\"male youth\") to refer to those from Keratea; this usage was later expanded by Henri Lechat in 1904 to cover all statues of this format.[434][435]\nThe earliest examples of life-sized statues of Apollo may be two figures from the Ionic sanctuary on the island of Delos. Such statues were found across the Greek-speaking world, the preponderance of these were found at the sanctuaries of Apollo with more than one hundred from the sanctuary of Apollo Ptoios, Boeotia alone.[436] Significantly more rare are the life-sized bronze statues. One of the few originals which survived into the present day—so rare that its discovery in 1959 was described as \"a miracle\" by Ernst Homann-Wedeking—is the masterpiece bronze, Piraeus Apollo. It was found in Piraeus, a port city close to Athens, and is believed to have come from north-eastern Peloponnesus. It is the only surviving large-scale Peloponnesian statue.[437]\n\nClassical sculpture\nApollo of Mantua, marble Roman copy after a 5th-century-BCE Greek original attributed to Polykleitos, Musée du Louvre\nMarble sculpture of Apollo and Marsyas by Walter Runeberg, at the arrivals hall of Ateneum in Helsinki, Finland\nThe famous Apollo of Mantua and its variants are early forms of the Apollo Citharoedus statue type, in which the god holds the cithara, a sophisticated seven-stringed variant of the lyre, in his left arm. While none of the Greek originals have survived, several Roman copies from approximately the late 1st or early 2nd century exist, of which an example is the Apollo Barberini.[citation needed]\n\nHellenistic Greece-Rome\nApollo as a handsome beardless young man, is often depicted with a cithara (as Apollo Citharoedus) or bow in his hand, or reclining on a tree (the Apollo Lykeios and Apollo Sauroctonos types). The Apollo Belvedere is a marble sculpture that was rediscovered in the late 15th century; for centuries it epitomized the ideals of Classical Antiquity for Europeans, from the Renaissance through the 19th century. The marble is a Hellenistic or Roman copy of a bronze original by the Greek sculptor Leochares, made between 330 and 320 BCE.[438]\nAnother haloed Apollo in mosaic, from Hadrumentum, is in the museum at Sousse.[439] The conventions of this representation, head tilted, lips slightly parted, large-eyed, curling hair cut in locks grazing the neck, were developed in the 3rd century BCE to depict Alexander the Great.[440] Some time after this mosaic was executed, the earliest depictions of Christ would also be beardless and haloed.[citation needed]\n\nModern reception\nApollo often appears in modern and popular culture due to his status as the god of music, dance and poetry.\n\nPostclassical art and literature\nDance and music\nApollo has featured in dance and music in modern culture. Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a \"Hymn of Apollo\" (1820), and the god's instruction of the Muses formed the subject of Igor Stravinsky's Apollon musagète (1927–1928). In 1978, the Canadian band Rush released an album with songs \"Apollo: Bringer of Wisdom\"/\"Dionysus: Bringer of Love\".[441]\n\nBooks\nApollo has been portrayed in modern literature, such as when Charles Handy in Gods of Management (1978) uses Greek gods as a metaphor to portray various types of organizational culture. Apollo represents a \"role\" culture where order, reason, and bureaucracy prevail.[442]\n\nPsychology and philosophy\nSee also: Apollonian and Dionysian and Apollo archetype\nIn the philosophical discussion of the arts, a distinction is sometimes made between the Apollonian and Dionysian impulses, where the former is concerned with imposing intellectual order and the latter with chaotic creativity. Friedrich Nietzsche argued that a fusion of the two was most desirable.[443] Psychologist Carl Jung's Apollo archetype represents what he saw as the disposition in people to over-intellectualise and maintain emotional distance.[444]\n\nSpaceflight\nSee also: Apollo program\nIn spaceflight, the 1960s and 1970s NASA program for orbiting and landing astronauts on the Moon was named after Apollo, by NASA manager Abe Silverstein:\n\nApollo riding his chariot across the Sun was appropriate to the grand scale of the proposed program.[445]— Abe Silverstein, Release 69-36\nGenealogy\n\n\nApollo's family tree[446]\n\n\n\n\nGaia\n\nUranus\n\nUranus's genitalsCoeusPhoebeCronusRhea\n\nLetoZeusHeraPoseidonHadesDemeterHestia\n\nAPOLLOArtemis    a[447]\n     b[448]\n\nAresHephaestus\nMetis\nAthena[449]\nMaia\nHermes\nSemele\nDionysus\nDione\n    a[450]     b[451]\n\nAphrodite\n\n\nSee also\n\nAncient Greece portalMyths portalReligion portal\n\nDarrhon – Paeonian god of healing\nDryad – Tree nymph in Greek mythology\nEpirus – Historical region in the Balkans\nFamily tree of the Greek gods – Mythological family tree\nList of solar deities\nPhoebus (disambiguation)\nSibylline Oracles – Collection of oracular utterances\nSolar deity – Sky deity who represents the Sun\nTegyra – Site of an oracle of Apollo\nTemple of Apollo (disambiguation)\n\nNotes\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ a b Price, Fred W.

ISSNs are used in ordering, cataloging, interlibrary loans, and other practices in connection with serial literature.[2]\nThe ISSN system was first drafted as an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) international standard in 1971 and published as ISO 3297 in 1975.[3] ISO subcommittee TC 46/SC 9 is responsible for maintaining the standard.\nWhen a serial with the same content is published in more than one media type, a different ISSN is assigned to each media type. For example, many serials are published both in print and electronic media. The ISSN system refers to these types as print ISSN (p-ISSN) and electronic ISSN (e-ISSN).[4] Consequently, as defined in ISO 3297:2007, every serial in the ISSN system is also assigned a linking ISSN (ISSN-L), typically the same as the ISSN assigned to the serial in its first published medium, which links together all ISSNs assigned to the serial in every medium.[5]\n\n\nCode format[edit]\nAn ISSN is an eight-digit code, divided by a hyphen into two four-digit numbers.[1] The last digit, which may be zero through nine or an X, is a check digit, so the ISSN is uniquely represented by its first seven digits. Formally, the general form of the ISSN (also named \"ISSN structure\" or \"ISSN syntax\") can be expressed as follows:[6]\n\nNNNN-NNNC\nwhere N is in the set {0,1,2,...,9}, a decimal digit character, and C is in {0,1,2,...,9,X}; or by a Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) regular expression:\n\n^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{3}[0-9X]$.\nFor example, the ISSN of the journal Hearing Research, is 0378-5955, where the final 5 is the check digit, that is C=5. To calculate the check digit, the following algorithm may be used:\n\nEach of the first seven digits of the ISSN is multiplied by its position in the number, counting from the right, that is, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2, respectively, and the resulting products are added:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n⋅\n8\n+\n3\n⋅\n7\n+\n7\n⋅\n6\n+\n8\n⋅\n5\n+\n5\n⋅\n4\n+\n9\n⋅\n3\n+\n5\n⋅\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n0\n+\n21\n+\n42\n+\n40\n+\n20\n+\n27\n+\n10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\n160\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}&0\\cdot 8+3\\cdot 7+7\\cdot 6+8\\cdot 5+5\\cdot 4+9\\cdot 3+5\\cdot 2\\\\&=0+21+42+40+20+27+10\\\\&=160\\;.\\end{aligned}}}\n\n\nThe remainder of this sum modulo 11 is then calculated:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n160\n11\n\n\n=\n14\n\n\n remainder \n\n\n6\n=\n14\n+\n\n\n6\n11\n\n\n\n\n{\\displaystyle {\\frac {160}{11}}=14{\\mbox{ remainder }}6=14+{\\frac {6}{11}}}\n\n\nIf there is no remainder, the check digit is 0; otherwise the remainder is subtracted from 11. If the result is less than 10, it yields the check digit:\n\n\n\n\n11\n−\n6\n=\n5\n\n.\n\n\n{\\displaystyle 11-6=5\\;.}\n\n\nThus, in this example, the check digit C is 5.\n\nIf the result is 10 (that is, if the remainder is 1), the check digit is an uppercase X (like a Roman ten).\nTo confirm the check digit, calculate the sum of all eight digits of the ISSN multiplied by their position in the number, counting from the right. (If the check digit is X, add 10 to the sum.) The remainder of the sum modulo 11 must be 0. There is an online ISSN checker that can validate an ISSN, based on the above algorithm.[citation needed]\n\nIn EANs[edit]\nISSNs can be encoded in EAN-13 bar codes with a 977 \"country code\" (compare the 978 \"bookland\" country code for ISBNs), followed by the 7 main digits of the ISSN (the check digit is not included), followed by 2 publisher-defined digits, followed by the EAN check digit (in most cases, this will not match the ISSN check digit, since they are each calculated in a different way).[7]\n\nCode assignment, maintenance and look-up[edit]\nISSN codes are assigned by a network of ISSN National Centres, usually located at national libraries and coordinated by the ISSN International Centre (CIEPS[8]) based in Paris. The International Centre is an intergovernmental organization created in 1974 through an agreement between UNESCO and the French government.\n\nLinking ISSN[edit]\nISSN-L is a unique identifier for all versions of the serial containing the same content across different media. As defined by ISO 3297:2007, the \"linking ISSN (ISSN-L)\" provides a mechanism for collocation or linking among the different media versions of the same continuing resource. The ISSN-L is one of a serial's existing ISSNs, so does not change the use or assignment of \"ordinary\" ISSNs;[9] it is based on the ISSN of the first published medium version of the publication. If the print and online versions of the publication are published at the same time, the ISSN of the print version is chosen as the basis of the ISSN-L.\nWith ISSN-L is possible to designate one single ISSN for all those media versions of the title. The use of ISSN-L facilitates search, retrieval and delivery across all media versions for services like OpenURL, library catalogues, search engines or knowledge bases.\n\nRegister[edit]\nThe International Centre maintains a database of all ISSNs assigned worldwide, the ISDS Register (International Serials Data System), otherwise known as the ISSN Register. At the end of 2016,[update] the ISSN Register contained records for 1,943,572 items.[10] The Register is not freely available for interrogation on the web, but is available by subscription.\n\nThe print version of a serial typically will include the ISSN code as part of the publication information.\nMost serial websites contain ISSN code information.\nDerivative lists of publications will often contain ISSN codes; these can be found through on-line searches with the ISSN code itself or serial title.\nWorldCat permits searching its catalog by ISSN, by entering \"issn:\" before the code in the query field. One can also go directly to an ISSN's record by appending it to \"https://www.worldcat.org/ISSN/\", e.g. n2:1021-9749 – Search Results. This does not query the ISSN Register itself, but rather shows whether any WorldCat library holds an item with the given ISSN.\nComparison with other identifiers[edit]\nISSN and ISBN codes are similar in concept, where ISBNs are assigned to individual books. An ISBN might be assigned for particular issues of a serial, in addition to the ISSN code for the serial as a whole. An ISSN, unlike the ISBN code, is an anonymous identifier associated with a serial title, containing no information as to the publisher or its location. For this reason a new ISSN is assigned to a serial each time it undergoes a major title change.\n\nExtensions[edit]\nSince the ISSN applies to an entire serial, other identifiers have been built on top of it to allow references to specific volumes, articles, or other identifiable components (like the table of contents): the Publisher Item Identifier (PII) and the Serial Item and Contribution Identifier (SICI).\n\nMedia versus content [edit]\nSeparate ISSNs are needed for serials in different media (except reproduction microforms). Thus, the print and electronic media versions of a serial need separate ISSNs,[11] and CD-ROM versions and web versions require different ISSNs. However, the same ISSN can be used for different file formats (e.g. PDF and HTML) of the same online serial.\nThis \"media-oriented identification\" of serials made sense in the 1970s. In the 1990s and onward, with personal computers, better screens, and the Web, it makes sense to consider only content, independent of media. This \"content-oriented identification\" of serials was a repressed demand during a decade, but no ISSN update or initiative occurred. A natural extension for ISSN, the unique-identification of the articles in the serials, was the main demand application. An alternative serials' contents model arrived with the indecs Content Model and its application, the digital object identifier (DOI), an ISSN-independent initiative, consolidated in the 2000s.\nOnly later, in 2007, ISSN-L was defined in the new ISSN standard (ISO 3297:2007) as an \"ISSN designated by the ISSN Network to enable collocation or versions of a continuing resource linking among the different media\".[12]\n\nUse in URNs[edit]\nAn ISSN can be encoded as a uniform resource name (URN) by prefixing it with \"urn:ISSN:\".[6] For example, Rail could be referred to as \"urn:ISSN:0953-4563\". URN namespaces are case-sensitive, and the ISSN namespace is all caps.[13] If the checksum digit is \"X\" then it is always encoded in uppercase in a URN.\n\nProblems[edit]\nThe URNs are content-oriented, but ISSN is media-oriented:\n\nISSN is not unique when the concept is \"a journal is a set of contents, generally copyrighted content\": the same journal (same contents and same copyrights) may have two or more ISSN codes. A URN needs to point to \"unique content\" (a \"unique journal\" as a \"set of contents\" reference).\nExample: Nature has an ISSN for print, 0028-0836, and another for the same content on the Web, 1476-4687; only the oldest (0028-0836) is used as a unique identifier. As the ISSN is not unique, the U.S. National Library of Medicine needed to create, prior to 2007, the NLM Unique ID (JID).[14]\nISSN does not offer resolution mechanisms like a digital object identifier (DOI) or a URN does, so the DOI is used as a URN for articles, with (for historical reasons) no need for an ISSN's existence.\nExample: the DOI name \"10.1038/nature13777\" can be represented as an HTTP string by https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13777, and is redirected (resolved) to the current article's page; but there is no ISSN online service, like http://dx.issn.org/, to resolve the ISSN of the journal (in this sample 1476-4687).\nA unique URN for serials simplifies the search, recovery and delivery of data for various services including, in particular, search systems and knowledge databases.[12] ISSN-L (see Linking ISSN above) was created to fill this gap.\n\nMedia category labels[edit]\nThe two standard categories of media in which serials are most available are print and electronic. In metadata contexts (e.g., JATS), these may have standard labels.\n\nPrint ISSN[edit]\np-ISSN is a standard label for \"Print ISSN\", the ISSN for the print media (paper) version of a serial. Usually it is the \"default media\" and so the \"default ISSN\".\n\nElectronic ISSN [edit]\ne-ISSN (or eISSN) is a standard label for \"Electronic ISSN\", the ISSN for the electronic media (online) version of a serial.[15]\n\nROAD[edit]\nROAD: Directory of Open Access Scholarly Resources [it] (est. 2013), produced by the ISSN International Centre and UNESCO[16]\nSee also[edit]\nCODEN\nWorldCat—an ISSN-resolve service\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b \"What is an ISSN?\".

By Alberto Pisa, 1905\nA pope is the Bishop of Rome and the leader of the Catholic Church. Approximately 100 papal tombs are at least partially extant, representing fewer than half of the 266 deceased popes, from Saint Peter to Pope Francis.[1]\nFor the first few centuries in particular, little is known of the popes and their tombs, and available information is often contradictory. As with other religious relics, multiple sites claim to house the same tomb. Furthermore, many papal tombs that recycled sarcophagi and other materials from earlier tombs were later recycled for their valuable materials or combined with other monuments. For example, the tomb of Pope Leo I was combined with Leos II, III, and IV circa 855, and then removed in the seventeenth century and placed under his own altar, below Alessandro Algardi's relief, Fuga d'Attila. The style of papal tombs has evolved considerably throughout history, tracking trends in the development of church monuments.[2] Notable papal tombs have been commissioned from sculptors such as Michelangelo and Gian Lorenzo Bernini.\nMost extant papal tombs are located in St. Peter's Basilica, other major churches of Rome (especially Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran, Santa Maria sopra Minerva and Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore), or other churches of Italy, France, and Germany.[3]\n\n\n\nPapal tombs by century of the pontificate\n\n\n\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n5th\n6th\n7th\n8th\n9th\n10th\n11th\n12th\n13th\n14th\n15th\n16th\n17th\n18th\n19th\n20th\n21st\n\n\n\nNon-extant · Antipopes\n\n\n\nNote on non-extant tombs[edit]\nMain article: List of non-extant papal tombs\nMany early tombs no longer exist due to repeated translations or destruction. This list does not include non-extant papal tombs. Information about these tombs is generally incomplete and uncertain. Locations of destroyed or lost papal tombs include:\n\nSaint Peter's tomb, around which the following popes were traditionally believed to have been buried: Pope Linus, Pope Anacletus, Pope Evaristus, Pope Telesphorus, Pope Hyginus, Pope Pius I, Pope Anicetus (later transferred to the Catacomb of Callixtus), and Pope Victor I.[4] Epigraphic evidence exists only for Linus, with the discovery of a burial slab marked \"Linus\" in 1615; however, the slab is broken such that it could have once read \"Aquilinus\" or \"Anullinus\".[5]\nThe Catacombs of Rome, specifically the Catacomb of Callixtus, the Catacomb of Priscilla (beneath San Martino ai Monti), the Catacomb of Balbina, the Catacomb of Calepodius, the Catacomb of Pontian, and the Catacomb of Felicitas, which were emptied by repeated translations by the ninth century.[6]\nPapal tombs in Old St. Peter's Basilica, which once numbered over 100 papal tombs, nearly all of which were destroyed during the sixteenth/seventeenth century demolition.[7]\nArchbasilica of Saint John Lateran, where over a dozen tombs were destroyed in two fires (1308 and 1361).[8]\nOther tombs not included in this list are:\n\nTombs of antipopes, which—with few exceptions—are obscure or destroyed. An antipope is a historical papal claimant currently regarded by the Roman Catholic Church as illegitimate.  Notably, however, the Tomb of Antipope John XXIII is in the Battistero di San Giovanni in Florence.\nSanti Vincenzo e Anastasio a Trevi, the resting place of the precordium of 22 popes from Sixtus V (1585–1590) to Leo XIII (1878–1903).\n1st–5th centuries[edit]\n1st century[edit]\n\n\n\nPontificate\n\nPortrait\n\nCommon English name\n\nImage\n\nSculptor\n\nLocation\n\nNotes\n\n\n30–67(as Head of the Church)\n\n\n\nPeterSaint Peter\n\n\n\nGian Lorenzo Bernini (baldachin)\n\nSt. Peter's Basilica, Vatican City (Rome)\n\nSee Saint Peter's tomb\n\n\npost 42 / ante 57–64/67(?)(as Bishop of Rome)\n\n2nd century[edit]\n\n\nPontificate\n\nPortrait\n\nCommon English name\n\nImage\n\nSculptor\n\nLocation\n\nNotes\n\n\nc. 157–168\n\n\n\nAnicetusSaint Anicetus\n\n\n\n\n\nPalazzo Altemps (Piazza Navona), Rome\n\nRemains transferred from Vatican Hill to the Cemetery of Callixtus and possibly again thereafter;[9] sarcophagus which may once have contained remains is extant in the Palazzo Altemps[10]\n\n3rd century[edit]\n\n\nPontificate\n\nPortrait\n\nCommon English name\n\nImage\n\nSculptor\n\nLocation\n\nNotes\n\n\n25 June 253 – 5 March 254\n\n\n\nLucius ISaint Lucius\n\n\n\n\n\nSanta Cecilia in Trastevere, Rome\n\nTransferred from the Catacomb of Callixtus to one or more of: Santa Cecilia in Trastevere, San Silvestro in Capite, and Santa Prassede;[11] sarcophagus that once held remains is extant in the crypt of Santa Cecilia in Trastevere[10]\n\n\n17 December 283 – 22 April 296\n\n\n\nCaiusSaint Caius\n\n\n\n\n\nSant'Andrea della Valle (Barberini chapel), Rome\n\nTranslated from the crypt of St. Eusebius in the Cemetery of Callixtus to San Silvestre in Capite, then to another church, then to the private chapel of the Barberini princes in Sant'Andrea della Valle[12]\n\n4th century[edit]\n\n\nPontificate\n\nPortrait\n\nCommon English name\n\nImage\n\nSculptor\n\nLocation\n\nNotes\n\n\n18 January 336 – 7 October 336\n\n\n\nMarkSaint Mark\n\n\n\n\n\nSan Marco Evangelista al Campidoglio, Rome\n\nTranslated from the Catacomb of Balbina, one of the Catacombs of Rome, to an urn below the main altar of San Marco[13]\n\n5th century[edit]\n\n\nPontificate\n\nPortrait\n\nCommon English name\n\nImage\n\nSculptor\n\nLocation\n\nNotes\n\n\n29 September 440 – 10 November 461\n\n\n\nLeo ISaint LeoLeo the Great\n\n\n\nAlessandro Algardi (relief)\n\nSt. Peter's Basilica, Chapel of the Madonna of Partorienti\n\nFirst pope buried on the porch of Old St. Peter's Basilica; translated multiple times, combined with Leos II, III, and IV circa 855; removed in the seventeenth century and placed under his own altar, below Algardi's relief, Fuga d'Attila (pictured)[14]\n\n6th–10th centuries[edit]\n6th century[edit]\n\n\nPontificate\n\nPortrait\n\nCommon English name\n\nImage\n\nSculptor\n\nLocation\n\nNotes\n\n\n3 September 590 – 12 March 604\n\n\n\nGregory I, O.S.B.

        "content": "Search service for journal articles\n\n\nSemantic ScholarType of siteSearch engineCreated byAllen Institute for Artificial IntelligenceURLsemanticscholar.orgLaunchedNovember 2, 2015; 9 years ago (2015-11-02)[1]\nSemantic Scholar is a research tool for scientific literature. It is developed at the Allen Institute for AI and was publicly released in November 2015.[2] Semantic Scholar uses modern techniques in natural language processing to support the research process, for example by providing automatically generated summaries of scholarly papers.[3] The Semantic Scholar team is actively researching the use of artificial intelligence in natural language processing, machine learning, human–computer interaction, and information retrieval.[4]\nSemantic Scholar began as a database for the topics of computer science, geoscience, and neuroscience.[5] In 2017, the system began including biomedical literature in its corpus.[5] As of September 2022[update], it includes over 200 million publications from all fields of science.[6]\n\n\nTechnology[edit]\nSemantic Scholar provides a one-sentence summary of scientific literature. One of its aims was to address the challenge of reading numerous titles and lengthy abstracts on mobile devices.[7] It also seeks to ensure that the three million scientific papers published yearly reach readers, since it is estimated that only half of this literature is ever read.[8]\nArtificial intelligence is used to capture the essence of a paper, generating it through an \"abstractive\" technique.[3] The project uses a combination of machine learning, natural language processing, and machine vision to add a layer of semantic analysis to the traditional methods of citation analysis, and to extract relevant figures, tables, entities, and venues from papers.[9][10]\nAnother key AI-powered feature is Research Feeds, an adaptive research recommender that uses AI to quickly learn what papers users care about reading and recommends the latest research to help scholars stay up to date. It uses a state-of-the-art paper embedding model trained using contrastive learning to find papers similar to those in each Library folder.[11]\nSemantic Scholar also offers Semantic Reader, an augmented reader with the potential to revolutionize scientific reading by making it more accessible and richly contextual.[12] Semantic Reader provides in-line citation cards that allow users to see citations with TLDR (short for Too Long, Didn't Read) automatically generated short summaries as they read and skimming highlights that capture key points of a paper so users can digest faster.\nIn contrast with Google Scholar and PubMed, Semantic Scholar is designed to highlight the most important and influential elements of a paper.[13] The AI technology is designed to identify hidden connections and links between research topics.[14] Like the previously cited search engines, Semantic Scholar also exploits graph structures, which include the Microsoft Academic Knowledge Graph, Springer Nature's SciGraph, and the Semantic Scholar Corpus (originally a 45 million papers corpus in computer science, neuroscience and biomedicine).[15][16]\n\nArticle identifier [edit]\nEach paper hosted by Semantic Scholar is assigned a unique identifier called the Semantic Scholar Corpus ID (abbreviated S2CID). The following entry is an example:\n\nLiu, Ying; Gayle, Albert A; Wilder-Smith, Annelies; Rocklöv, Joacim (March 2020). \"The reproductive number of COVID-19 is higher compared to SARS coronavirus\". Journal of Travel Medicine. 27 (2). doi:10.1093/jtm/taaa021. PMID 32052846. S2CID 211099356.\nIndexing[edit]\nSemantic Scholar is free to use and unlike similar search engines (i.e. Google Scholar) does not search for material that is behind a paywall.[5][better source needed]\nOne study compared the index scope of Semantic Scholar to Google Scholar, and found that for the papers cited by secondary studies in computer science, the two indices had comparable coverage, each only missing a handful of the papers.[17]\n\nNumber of users and publications[edit]\nAs of January 2018, following a 2017 project that added biomedical papers and topic summaries, the Semantic Scholar corpus included more than 40 million papers from computer science and biomedicine.[18] In March 2018, Doug Raymond, who developed machine learning initiatives for the Amazon Alexa platform, was hired to lead the Semantic Scholar project.[19] As of August 2019[update], the number of included papers metadata (not the actual PDFs) had grown to more than 173 million[20] after the addition of the Microsoft Academic Graph records.[21] In 2020, a partnership between Semantic Scholar and the University of Chicago Press Journals made all articles published under the University of Chicago Press available in the Semantic Scholar corpus.[22] At the end of 2020, Semantic Scholar had indexed 190 million papers.[23] In 2020, Semantic Scholar reached seven million users per month.[7]\n\nSee also[edit]\nCitation analysis – Examination of the frequency, patterns, and graphs of citations in documents\nCitation index – Index of citations between publications\nKnowledge extraction – Creation of knowledge from structured and unstructured sources\nList of academic databases and search engines\nScientometrics – Quantitative study of scholarly literature\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Jones, Nicola (2015). \"Artificial-intelligence institute launches free science search engine\".

Its secure variant named HTTPS is used by more than 85% of websites.[8]\nHTTP/2, published in 2015, provides a more efficient expression of HTTP's semantics \"on the wire\". As of August 2024,[update] it is supported by 66.2% of websites[9][10] (35.3% HTTP/2 + 30.9% HTTP/3 with backwards compatibility) and supported by almost all web browsers (over 98% of users).[11] It is also supported by major web servers over Transport Layer Security (TLS) using an Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) extension[12] where TLS 1.2 or newer is required.[13]\nHTTP/3, the successor to HTTP/2, was published in 2022.[14] As of February 2024,[update] it is now used on 30.9% of websites[15] and is supported by most web browsers, i.e. (at least partially) supported by 97% of users.[16] HTTP/3 uses QUIC instead of TCP for the underlying transport protocol. Like HTTP/2, it does not obsolete previous major versions of the protocol. In 2019, support for HTTP/3 was first added to Cloudflare and Google Chrome,[17][18] and also enabled in Firefox.[19] HTTP/3 has lower latency for real-world web pages, if enabled on the server, and loads faster than with HTTP/2, in some cases over three times faster than HTTP/1.1 (which is still commonly only enabled).[20]\n\n\nTechnical overview\nHTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server model. A web browser, for example, may be the client whereas a process, named web server, running on a computer hosting one or more websites may be the server. The client submits an HTTP request message to the server. The server, which provides resources such as HTML files and other content or performs other functions on behalf of the client, returns a response message to the client. The response contains completion status information about the request and may also contain requested content in its message body.\nA web browser is an example of a user agent (UA). Other types of user agent include the indexing software used by search providers (web crawlers), voice browsers, mobile apps, and other software that accesses, consumes, or displays web content.\nHTTP is designed to permit intermediate network elements to improve or enable communications between clients and servers. High-traffic websites often benefit from web cache servers that deliver content on behalf of upstream servers to improve response time. Web browsers cache previously accessed web resources and reuse them, whenever possible, to reduce network traffic. HTTP proxy servers at private network boundaries can facilitate communication for clients without a globally routable address, by relaying messages with external servers.\nTo allow intermediate HTTP nodes (proxy servers, web caches, etc.) to accomplish their functions, some of the HTTP headers (found in HTTP requests/responses) are managed hop-by-hop whereas other HTTP headers are managed end-to-end (managed only by the source client and by the target web server).\nHTTP is an application layer protocol designed within the framework of the Internet protocol suite. Its definition presumes an underlying and reliable transport layer protocol.[1]: §3.3 \n\nThe standard choice of the underlying protocol prior to HTTP/3 is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).\nHTTP/3 uses a different transport layer called QUIC, which provides reliability on top of the unreliable User Datagram Protocol (UDP).\nHTTP/1.1 and earlier have been adapted to be used over plain unreliable UDP in multicast and unicast situations, forming HTTPMU and HTTPU. They are used in UPnP and Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP), two protocols usually run on a local area network.\nHTTP resources are identified and located on the network by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), using the Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) schemes http and https. URIs are encoded as hyperlinks in HTML documents, so as to form interlinked hypertext documents.[21]\nIn HTTP/1.0 a separate TCP connection to the same server is made for every resource request.[4]: §1.3 \nIn HTTP/1.1 instead a TCP connection can be reused to make multiple resource requests (i.e. of HTML pages, frames, images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.).[22]: §9.1,9.3 \nHTTP/1.1 communications therefore experience less latency as the establishment of TCP connections presents considerable overhead, especially under high traffic conditions.[23]\nHTTP/2 is a revision of previous HTTP/1.1 in order to maintain the same client–server model and the same protocol methods but with these differences in order:\n\nto use a compressed binary representation of metadata (HTTP headers) instead of a textual one, so that headers require much less space;\nto use a single TCP/IP (usually encrypted) connection per accessed server domain instead of 2 to 8 TCP/IP connections;\nto use one or more bidirectional streams per TCP/IP connection in which HTTP requests and responses are broken down and transmitted in small packets to almost solve the problem of the HOLB (head-of-line blocking).[note 1]\nto add a push capability to allow server application to send data to clients whenever new data is available (without forcing clients to request periodically new data to server by using polling methods).[13]: §2 \nHTTP/2 communications therefore experience much less latency and, in most cases, even higher speeds than HTTP/1.1 communications.\nHTTP/3 is a revision of previous HTTP/2 in order to use QUIC + UDP transport protocols instead of TCP. Before that version, TCP/IP connections were used; but now, only the IP layer is used (which UDP, like TCP, builds on). This slightly improves the average speed of communications and to avoid the occasional (very rare) problem of TCP connection congestion that can temporarily block or slow down the data flow of all its streams (another form of \"head of line blocking\").\n\nHistory\nTim Berners-Lee \nThe term hypertext was coined by Ted Nelson in 1965 in the Xanadu Project, which was in turn inspired by Vannevar Bush's 1930s vision of the microfilm-based information retrieval and management \"memex\" system described in his 1945 essay \"As We May Think\". Tim Berners-Lee and his team at CERN are credited with inventing the original HTTP, along with HTML and the associated technology for a web server and a client user interface called web browser. Berners-Lee designed HTTP in order to help with the adoption of his other idea: the \"WorldWideWeb\" project, which was first proposed in 1989, now known as the World Wide Web.\nThe first web server went live in 1990.[24][25] The protocol used had only one method, namely GET, which would request a page from a server.[26] The response from the server was always an HTML page.[2]\n\nSummary of HTTP milestone versions\n\n\nVersion\n\nYear introduced\n\nCurrent status\n\nUsage in August 2024[update]\n\nSupport in August 2024[update]\n\n\nHTTP/0.9\n\n1991\n\nObsolete\n\n0\n\n100%\n\n\nHTTP/1.0\n\n1996\n\nObsolete\n\n0\n\n100%\n\n\nHTTP/1.1\n\n1997\n\nStandard\n\n33.8%\n\n100%\n\n\nHTTP/2\n\n2015\n\nStandard\n\n35.3%\n\n66.2%\n\n\nHTTP/3\n\n2022\n\nStandard\n\n30.9%\n\n30.9%\n\nHTTP/0.9\nIn 1991, the first documented official version of HTTP was written as a plain document, less than 700 words long, and this version was named HTTP/0.9, which supported only GET method, allowing clients to only retrieve HTML documents from the server, but not supporting any other file formats or information upload.[2]\n\nHTTP/1.0-draft\nSince 1992, a new document was written to specify the evolution of the basic protocol towards its next full version. It supported both the simple request method of the 0.9 version and the full GET request that included the client HTTP version. This was the first of the many unofficial HTTP/1.0 drafts that preceded the final work on HTTP/1.0.[3]\n\nW3C HTTP Working Group\nAfter having decided that new features of HTTP protocol were required and that they had to be fully documented as official RFCs, in early 1995 the HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG, led by Dave Raggett) was constituted with the aim to standardize and expand the protocol with extended operations, extended negotiation, richer meta-information, tied with a security protocol which became more efficient by adding additional methods and header fields.[27][28]\nThe HTTP WG planned to revise and publish new versions of the protocol as HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 within 1995, but, because of the many revisions, that timeline lasted much more than one year.[29]\nThe HTTP WG planned also to specify a far future version of HTTP called HTTP-NG (HTTP Next Generation) that would have solved all remaining problems, of previous versions, related to performances, low latency responses, etc. but this work started only a few years later and it was never completed.\n\nHTTP/1.0\nIn May 1996, RFC 1945[4] was published as a final HTTP/1.0 revision of what had been used in previous 4 years as a pre-standard HTTP/1.0-draft which was already used by many web browsers and web servers.\nIn early 1996 developers started to even include unofficial extensions of the HTTP/1.0 protocol (i.e. keep-alive connections, etc.) into their products by using drafts of the upcoming HTTP/1.1 specifications.[30]\n\nHTTP/1.1\nSince early 1996, major web browsers and web server developers also started to implement new features specified by pre-standard HTTP/1.1 drafts specifications.  End-user adoption of the new versions of browsers and servers was rapid. In March 1996, one web hosting company reported that over 40% of browsers in use on the Internet used the new HTTP/1.1 header \"Host\" to enable virtual hosting, and that by June 1996, 65% of all browsers accessing their servers were pre-standard HTTP/1.1 compliant.[31]\nIn January 1997, RFC 2068[5] was officially released as HTTP/1.1 specifications.\nIn June 1999, RFC 2616[6] was released to include all improvements and updates based on previous (obsolete) HTTP/1.1 specifications.\n\nW3C HTTP-NG Working Group\nResuming the old 1995 plan of previous HTTP Working Group, in 1997 an HTTP-NG Working Group was formed to develop a new HTTP protocol named HTTP-NG (HTTP New Generation).  A few proposals / drafts were produced for the new protocol to use multiplexing of HTTP transactions inside a single TCP/IP connection, but in 1999, the group stopped its activity passing the technical problems to IETF.[32]\n\nIETF HTTP Working Group restarted\nIn 2007, the IETF HTTP Working Group (HTTP WG bis or HTTPbis) was restarted firstly to revise and clarify previous HTTP/1.1 specifications and secondly to write and refine future HTTP/2 specifications (named httpbis).[33][34]\n\nSPDY: an unofficial HTTP protocol developed by Google\nIn 2009, Google, a private company, announced that it had developed and tested a new HTTP binary protocol named SPDY. The implicit aim was to greatly speed up web traffic (specially between future web browsers and its servers).\nSPDY was indeed much faster than HTTP/1.1 in many tests and so it was quickly adopted by Chromium and then by other major web browsers.[35]\nSome of the ideas about multiplexing HTTP streams over a single TCP/IP connection were taken from various sources, including the work of W3C HTTP-NG Working Group.\n\nHTTP/2\nIn January–March 2012, HTTP Working Group (HTTPbis) announced the need to start to focus on a new HTTP/2 protocol (while finishing the revision of HTTP/1.1 specifications), maybe taking in consideration ideas and work done for SPDY.[36][37]\nAfter a few months about what to do to develop a new version of HTTP, it was decided to derive it from SPDY.[38]\nIn May 2015, HTTP/2 was published as RFC 7540[39] and quickly adopted by all web browsers already supporting SPDY and more slowly by web servers.\n\n2014 updates to HTTP/1.1\nIn June 2014, the HTTP Working Group released an updated six-part HTTP/1.1 specification obsoleting RFC 2616[6]:\n\nRFC 7230 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing,\"[7] Obsolete.\nRFC 7231 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content,\"[40] Obsolete.\nRFC 7232 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Conditional Requests,\"[41] Obsolete.\nRFC 7233 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Range Requests,\"[42] Obsolete.\nRFC 7234 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Caching,\"[43] Obsolete.\nRFC 7235 – \"Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Authentication,\"[44] Obsolete.\nHTTP/0.9 Deprecation\nIn 2014, HTTP/0.9 was deprecated for servers supporting version HTTP/1.1 (and higher):[7]: §Appendix A Since HTTP/0.9 did not support header fields in a request, there is no mechanism for it to support name-based virtual hosts (selection of resource by inspection of the Host header field).  Any server that implements name-based virtual hosts ought to disable support for HTTP/0.9.  Most requests that appear to be HTTP/0.9 are, in fact, badly constructed HTTP/1.x requests caused by a client failing to properly encode the request-target.\n\nSince 2016 many product managers and developers of user agents (browsers, etc.) and web servers have begun planning to gradually deprecate and dismiss support for HTTP/0.9 protocol, mainly for the following reasons:[45]\n\nit is so simple that an RFC document was never written (there is only the original document);[2]\nit has no HTTP headers and lacks many other features that nowadays are required for minimal security reasons;\nit has not been widespread since 1999..2000 (because of HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1) and is commonly used only by some very old network hardware, i.e. routers, etc.\n[note 2]\n\nHTTP/3\nIn 2020, the first drafts HTTP/3 were published and major web browsers and web servers started to adopt it.\nOn 6 June 2022, IETF standardized HTTP/3 as RFC 9114[14].\n\nUpdates and refactoring in 2022\nIn June 2022, a batch of RFCs was published, deprecating many of the previous documents and introducing a few minor changes and a refactoring of HTTP semantics description into a separate document.\n\nRFC 9110 – \"HTTP Semantics,\"[1] Internet Standard 97.\nRFC 9111 – \"HTTP Caching,\"[46] Internet Standard 98.\nRFC 9112 – \"HTTP/1.1,\"[22] Internet Standard 99.\nRFC 9113 – \"HTTP/2,\"[13] Proposed Standard.\nRFC 9114 – \"HTTP/3,\"[14] Proposed Standard.  (See also the section above.)\nRFC 9204 – \"QPACK: Field Compression for HTTP/3,\"[47] Proposed Standard.\nRFC 9218 – \"Extensible Prioritization Scheme for HTTP,\"[48] Proposed Standard.\nHTTP data exchange\nHTTP is a stateless application-level protocol and it requires a reliable network transport connection to exchange data between client and server.[49] In HTTP implementations, TCP/IP connections are used using well-known ports (typically port 80 if the connection is unencrypted or port 443 if the connection is encrypted, see also List of TCP and UDP port numbers).[1]: §4.2.1,4.2.2  In HTTP/2, a TCP/IP connection plus multiple protocol channels are used. In HTTP/3, the application transport protocol QUIC over UDP is used.\n\nRequest and response messages through connections\nData is exchanged through a sequence of request–response messages which are exchanged by a session layer transport connection.[49] An HTTP client initially tries to connect to a server establishing a connection (real or virtual). An HTTP(S) server listening on that port accepts the connection and then waits for a client's request message. The client sends its HTTP request message. Upon receiving the request the server sends back an HTTP response message, which includes header(s) plus a body if it is required. The body of this response message is typically the requested resource, although an error message or other information may also be returned. At any time (for many reasons) client or server can close the connection. Closing a connection is usually advertised in advance by using one or more HTTP headers in the last request/response message sent to server or client.[22]: §9.1 \n\nPersistent connections\nMain article: HTTP persistent connection\nIn HTTP/0.9, the TCP/IP connection is always closed after server response has been sent, so it is never persistent.\nIn HTTP/1.0, the TCP/IP connection should always be closed by server after a response has been sent.[4][note 3]\nIn HTTP/1.1 a keep-alive-mechanism was officially introduced so that a connection could be reused for more than one request/response. Such persistent connections reduce request latency perceptibly because the client does not need to re-negotiate the TCP 3-Way-Handshake connection after the first request has been sent. Another positive side effect is that, in general, the connection becomes faster with time due to TCP's slow-start-mechanism.\nHTTP/1.1 added also HTTP pipelining in order to further reduce lag time when using persistent connections by allowing clients to send multiple requests before waiting for each response.  This optimization was never considered really safe because a few web servers and many proxy servers, specially transparent proxy servers placed in Internet / Intranets between clients and servers, did not handle pipelined requests properly (they served only the first request discarding the others, they closed the connection because they saw more data after the first request or some proxies even returned responses out of order etc.).  Because of this, only HEAD and some GET requests (i.e. limited to real file requests and so with URLs without query string used as a command, etc.) could be pipelined in a safe and idempotent mode.  After many years of struggling with the problems introduced by enabling pipelining, this feature was first disabled and then removed from most browsers also because of the announced adoption of HTTP/2.\nHTTP/2 extended the usage of persistent connections by multiplexing many concurrent requests/responses through a single TCP/IP connection.\nHTTP/3 does not use TCP/IP connections but QUIC + UDP (see also: technical overview).\n\nContent retrieval optimizations\nHTTP/0.9\nA requested resource was always sent in its entirety.\nHTTP/1.0\nHTTP/1.0 added headers to manage resources cached by client in order to allow conditional GET requests; in practice a server has to return the entire content of the requested resource only if its last modified time is not known by client or if it changed since last full response to GET request. One of these headers, \"Content-Encoding\", was added to specify whether the returned content of a resource was or was not compressed.\nIf the total length of the content of a resource was not known in advance (i.e. because it was dynamically generated, etc.) then the header \"Content-Length: number\" was not present in HTTP headers and the client assumed that when server closed the connection, the content had been sent in its entirety.  This mechanism could not distinguish between a resource transfer successfully completed and an interrupted one (because of a server / network error or something else).\nHTTP/1.1\nHTTP/1.1 introduced:\nnew headers to better manage the conditional retrieval of cached resources.\nchunked transfer encoding to allow content to be streamed in chunks in order to reliably send it even when the server does not know its length in advance (i.e. because it is dynamically generated, etc.).\nbyte range serving, where a client can request only one or more portions (ranges of bytes) of a resource (i.e. the first part, a part in the middle or in the end of the entire content, etc.) and the server usually sends only the requested part(s).  This is useful to resume an interrupted download (when a file is very large), when only a part of a content has to be shown or dynamically added to the already visible part by a browser (i.e. only the first or the following n comments of a web page) in order to spare time, bandwidth and system resources, etc.\nHTTP/2, HTTP/3\nBoth HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 have kept the above mentioned features of HTTP/1.1.\nHTTP authentication\nHTTP provides multiple authentication schemes such as basic access authentication and digest access authentication which operate via a challenge–response mechanism whereby the server identifies and issues a challenge before serving the requested content.\nHTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication, via an extensible set of challenge–response authentication schemes, which can be used by a server to challenge a client request and by a client to provide authentication information.[1]\nThe authentication mechanisms described above belong to the HTTP protocol and are managed by client and server HTTP software (if configured to require authentication before allowing client access to one or more web resources), and not by the web applications using a web application session.\n\nAuthentication realms\nThe HTTP Authentication specification also provides an arbitrary, implementation-specific construct for further dividing resources common to a given root URI. The realm value string, if present, is combined with the canonical root URI to form the protection space component of the challenge. This in effect allows the server to define separate authentication scopes under one root URI.[1]\n\nHTTP application session \nHTTP is a stateless protocol. A stateless protocol does not require the web server to retain information or status about each user for the duration of multiple requests.\nSome web applications need to manage user sessions, so they implement states, or server side sessions, using for instance HTTP cookies[50] or hidden variables within web forms.\nTo start an application user session, an interactive authentication via web application login must be performed. To stop a user session a logout operation must be requested by user.  These kind of operations do not use HTTP authentication but a custom managed web application authentication.\n\nHTTP/1.1 request messages\nRequest messages are sent by a client to a target server.[note 4]\n\nRequest syntax\nA client sends request messages to the server, which consist of:[51]\n\na request line, consisting of the case-sensitive request method, a space, the requested URI, another space, the protocol version, a carriage return, and a line feed, e.g.:\nGET /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1\n\nzero or more request header fields (at least 1 or more headers in case of HTTP/1.1), each consisting of the case-insensitive field name, a colon, optional leading whitespace, the field value, an optional trailing whitespace and ending with a carriage return and a line feed, e.g.:\nHost: www.example.com\nAccept-Language: en\n\nan empty line, consisting of a carriage return and a line feed;\nan optional message body.\nIn the HTTP/1.1 protocol, all header fields except Host: hostname are optional.\nA request line containing only the path name is accepted by servers to maintain compatibility with HTTP clients before the HTTP/1.0 specification in RFC 1945.[52]\n\nRequest methods\nAn HTTP/1.1 request made using telnet. The request message, response header section, and response body are highlighted.\nHTTP defines methods (sometimes referred to as verbs, but nowhere in the specification does it mention verb) to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. What this resource represents, whether pre-existing data or data that is generated dynamically, depends on the implementation of the server. Often, the resource corresponds to a file or the output of an executable residing on the server. The HTTP/1.0 specification[4]: §8  defined the GET, HEAD, and POST methods as well as listing the PUT, DELETE, LINK and UNLINK methods under additional methods.  However, the HTTP/1.1 specification[6]: §9  formally defined and added five new methods: PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, and TRACE. Any client can use any method and the server can be configured to support any combination of methods. If a method is unknown to an intermediate, it will be treated as an unsafe and non-idempotent method. There is no limit to the number of methods that can be defined, which allows for future methods to be specified without breaking existing infrastructure. For example, WebDAV defined seven new methods and RFC 5789 specified the PATCH method.\nMethod names are case sensitive.[22]: §3 [1]: §9.1  This is in contrast to HTTP header field names which are case-insensitive.[1]: §6.3 \n\n\nGET\nThe GET method requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state. GET requests should only retrieve data and should have no other effect. (This is also true of some other HTTP methods.)[1] For retrieving resources without making changes, GET is preferred over POST, as they can be addressed through a URL. This enables bookmarking and sharing and makes GET responses eligible for caching, which can save bandwidth. The W3C has published guidance principles on this distinction, saying, \"Web application design should be informed by the above principles, but also by the relevant limitations.\"[53] See safe methods below.\n\n\nHEAD\nThe HEAD method requests that the target resource transfer a representation of its state, as for a GET request, but without the representation data enclosed in the response body. This is useful for retrieving the representation metadata in the response header, without having to transfer the entire representation. Uses include checking whether a page is available through the status code and quickly finding the size of a file (Content-Length).\n\n\nPOST\nThe POST method requests that the target resource process the representation enclosed in the request according to the semantics of the target resource. For example, it is used for posting a message to an Internet forum, subscribing to a mailing list, or completing an online shopping transaction.[1]: §9.3.3 \n\n\nPUT\nThe PUT method requests that the target resource create or update its state with the state defined by the representation enclosed in the request. A distinction from POST is that the client specifies the target location on the server.[1]: §9.3.4 \n\n\nDELETE\nThe DELETE method requests that the target resource delete its state.\n\n\nCONNECT\nThe CONNECT method requests that the intermediary establish a TCP/IP tunnel to the origin server identified by the request target. It is often used to secure connections through one or more HTTP proxies with TLS.[1]: §9.3.6 [54] See HTTP CONNECT method.\n\n\nOPTIONS\nThe OPTIONS method requests that the target resource transfer the HTTP methods that it supports. This can be used to check the functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a specific resource.\n\n\nTRACE\nThe TRACE method requests that the target resource transfer the received request in the response body. That way a client can see what (if any) changes or additions have been made by intermediaries.\n\n\nPATCH\nThe PATCH method requests that the target resource modify its state according to the partial update defined in the representation enclosed in the request. This can save bandwidth by updating a part of a file or document without having to transfer it entirely.[55]\nAll general-purpose web servers are required to implement at least the GET and HEAD methods, and all other methods are considered optional by the specification.[1]: §9.1 \n\n\n\nProperties of request methods\n\n\nRequest method\n\nRFC\n\nRequest has payload body\n\nResponse has payload body\n\nSafe\n\nIdempotent\n\nCacheable\n\n\nGET\n\nRFC 9110\n\nOptional\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n\nHEAD\n\nRFC 9110\n\nOptional\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n\nPOST\n\nRFC 9110\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\n\nPUT\n\nRFC 9110\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n\nDELETE\n\nRFC 9110\n\nOptional\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n\nCONNECT\n\nRFC 9110\n\nOptional\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\n\nOPTIONS\n\nRFC 9110\n\nOptional\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n\nTRACE\n\nRFC 9110\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n\nPATCH\n\nRFC 5789\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nSafe methods\nA request method is safe if a request with that method has no intended effect on the server. The methods GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and TRACE are defined as safe. In other words, safe methods are intended to be read-only. Safe methods can still have side effects not seen by the client, such as appending request information to a log file or charging an advertising account.\nIn contrast, the methods POST, PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, and PATCH are not safe. They may modify the state of the server or have other effects such as sending an email. Such methods are therefore not usually used by conforming web robots or web crawlers; some that do not conform tend to make requests without regard to context or consequences.\nDespite the prescribed safety of GET requests, in practice their handling by the server is not technically limited in any way. Careless or deliberately irregular programming can allow GET requests to cause non-trivial changes on the server. This is discouraged because of the problems which can occur when web caching, search engines, and other automated agents make unintended changes on the server. For example, a website might allow deletion of a resource through a URL such as https://example.com/article/1234/delete, which, if arbitrarily fetched, even using GET, would simply delete the article.[56] A properly coded website would require a DELETE or POST method for this action, which non-malicious bots would not make.\nOne example of this occurring in practice was during the short-lived Google Web Accelerator beta, which prefetched arbitrary URLs on the page a user was viewing, causing records to be automatically altered or deleted en masse. The beta was suspended only weeks after its first release, following widespread criticism.[57][56]\n\nIdempotent methods\nSee also: Idempotence § Computer science meaning\nA request method is idempotent if multiple identical requests with that method have the same effect as a single such request. The methods PUT and DELETE, and safe methods are defined as idempotent. Safe methods are trivially idempotent, since they are intended to have no effect on the server whatsoever; the PUT and DELETE methods, meanwhile, are idempotent since successive identical requests will be ignored. A website might, for instance, set up a PUT endpoint to modify a user's recorded email address. If this endpoint is configured correctly, any requests which ask to change a user's email address to the same email address which is already recorded—e.g. duplicate requests following a successful request—will have no effect. Similarly, a request to DELETE a certain user will have no effect if that user has already been deleted.\nIn contrast, the methods POST, CONNECT, and PATCH are not necessarily idempotent, and therefore sending an identical POST request multiple times may further modify the state of the server or have further effects, such as sending multiple emails. In some cases this is the desired effect, but in other cases it may occur accidentally. A user might, for example, inadvertently send multiple POST requests by clicking a button again if they were not given clear feedback that the first click was being processed. While web browsers may show alert dialog boxes to warn users in some cases where reloading a page may re-submit a POST request, it is generally up to the web application to handle cases where a POST request should not be submitted more than once.\nNote that whether or not a method is idempotent is not enforced by the protocol or web server. It is perfectly possible to write a web application in which (for example) a database insert or other non-idempotent action is triggered by a GET or other request. To do so against recommendations, however, may result in undesirable consequences, if a user agent assumes that repeating the same request is safe when it is not.\n\nCacheable methods\nSee also: Web cache\nA request method is cacheable if responses to requests with that method may be stored for future reuse. The methods GET, HEAD, and POST are defined as cacheable.\nIn contrast, the methods PUT, DELETE, CONNECT, OPTIONS, TRACE, and PATCH are not cacheable.\n\nRequest header fields\nSee also: List of HTTP header fields § Request fields\nRequest header fields allow the client to pass additional information beyond the request line, acting as request modifiers (similarly to the parameters of a procedure). They give information about the client, about the target resource, or about the expected handling of the request.\n\nHTTP/1.1 response messages \nA response message is sent by a server to a client as a reply to its former request message.[note 4]\n\nResponse syntax\nA server sends response messages to the client, which consist of:[22]: §2.1 \n\na status line, consisting of the protocol version, a space, the response status code, another space, a possibly empty reason phrase, a carriage return and a line feed, e.g.:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n\nzero or more response header fields, each consisting of the case-insensitive field name, a colon, optional leading whitespace, the field value, an optional trailing whitespace and ending with a carriage return and a line feed, e.g.:\nContent-Type: text/html\n\nan empty line, consisting of a carriage return and a line feed;\nan optional message body.\nResponse status codes\nSee also: List of HTTP status codes\nIn HTTP/1.0 and since, the first line of the HTTP response is called the status line and includes a numeric status code (such as \"404\") and a textual reason phrase (such as \"Not Found\"). The response status code is a three-digit integer code representing the result of the server's attempt to understand and satisfy the client's corresponding request. The way the client handles the response depends primarily on the status code, and secondarily on the other response header fields. Clients may not understand all registered status codes but they must understand their class (given by the first digit of the status code) and treat an unrecognized status code as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class.\nThe standard reason phrases are only recommendations, and can be replaced with \"local equivalents\" at the web developer's discretion. If the status code indicated a problem, the user agent might display the reason phrase to the user to provide further information about the nature of the problem. The standard also allows the user agent to attempt to interpret the reason phrase, though this might be unwise since the standard explicitly specifies that status codes are machine-readable and reason phrases are human-readable.\nThe first digit of the status code defines its class:\n\n1XX (informational)\nThe request was received, continuing process.\n2XX (successful)\nThe request was successfully received, understood, and accepted.\n3XX (redirection)\nFurther action needs to be taken in order to complete the request.\n4XX (client error)\nThe request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled.\n5XX (server error)\nThe server failed to fulfill an apparently valid request.\nResponse header fields\nSee also: List of HTTP header fields § Response fields\nThe response header fields allow the server to pass additional information beyond the status line, acting as response modifiers. They give information about the server or about further access to the target resource or related resources.\nEach response header field has a defined meaning which can be further refined by the semantics of the request method or response status code.\n\nHTTP/1.1 example of request / response transaction\nBelow is a sample HTTP transaction between an HTTP/1.1 client and an HTTP/1.1 server running on www.example.com, port 80.[note 5][note 6]\n\nClient request\nGET / HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\nUser-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\nAccept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8\nAccept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br\nConnection: keep-alive\n\nA client request (consisting in this case of the request line and a few headers that can be reduced to only the \"Host: hostname\" header) is followed by a blank line, so that the request ends with a double end of line, each in the form of a carriage return followed by a line feed. The \"Host: hostname\" header value distinguishes between various DNS names sharing a single IP address, allowing name-based virtual hosting. While optional in HTTP/1.0, it is mandatory in HTTP/1.1. (A \"/\" (slash) will usually fetch a /index.html file if there is one.)\n\nServer response\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nDate: Mon, 23 May 2005 22:38:34 GMT\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\nContent-Length: 155\nLast-Modified: Wed, 08 Jan 2003 23:11:55 GMT\nServer: Apache/1.3.3.7 (Unix) (Red-Hat/Linux)\nETag: \"3f80f-1b6-3e1cb03b\"\nAccept-Ranges: bytes\nConnection: close\n\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>An Example Page</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>Hello World, this is a very simple HTML document.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n\nThe ETag (entity tag) header field is used to determine if a cached version of the requested resource is identical to the current version of the resource on the server. \"Content-Type\" specifies the Internet media type of the data conveyed by the HTTP message, while \"Content-Length\" indicates its length in bytes. The HTTP/1.1 webserver publishes its ability to respond to requests for certain byte ranges of the document by setting the field \"Accept-Ranges: bytes\". This is useful, if the client needs to have only certain portions[58] of a resource sent by the server, which is called byte serving. When \"Connection: close\" is sent, it means that the web server will close the TCP connection immediately after the end of the transfer of this response.[22]: §9.1 \nMost of the header lines are optional but some are mandatory. When header \"Content-Length: number\" is missing in a response with an entity body then this should be considered an error in HTTP/1.0 but it may not be an error in HTTP/1.1 if header \"Transfer-Encoding: chunked\" is present. Chunked transfer encoding uses a chunk size of 0 to mark the end of the content. Some old implementations of HTTP/1.0 omitted the header \"Content-Length\" when the length of the body entity was not known at the beginning of the response and so the transfer of data to client continued until server closed the socket.\nA \"Content-Encoding: gzip\" can be used to inform the client that the body entity part of the transmitted data is compressed by gzip algorithm.\n\nEncrypted connections\nThe most popular way of establishing an encrypted HTTP connection is HTTPS.[59] Two other methods for establishing an encrypted HTTP connection also exist: Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and using the HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header to specify an upgrade to TLS. Browser support for these two is, however, nearly non-existent.[60][61][62]\n\nSimilar protocols\nThe Gopher protocol is a content delivery protocol that was displaced by HTTP in the early 1990s.\nThe SPDY protocol is an alternative to HTTP developed at Google, superseded by HTTP/2.\nThe Gemini protocol is a Gopher-inspired protocol which mandates privacy-related features.\nSee also\nInterPlanetary File System – can replace HTTP\nComparison of file transfer protocols\nConstrained Application Protocol – a semantically similar protocol to HTTP but used UDP or UDP-like messages targeted for devices with limited processing capability; re-uses HTTP and other internet concepts like Internet media type and web linking (RFC 5988)[63]\nContent negotiation\nDigest access authentication\nHTTP compression\nHTTP/2 – developed by the IETF's Hypertext Transfer Protocol (httpbis) working group[34]\nList of HTTP header fields\nList of HTTP status codes\nRepresentational state transfer (REST)\nVariant object\nWireless Application Protocol\nWeb cache\nWebSocket\nNotes\n\n\n^ In practice, these streams are used as multiple TCP/IP sub-connections to multiplex concurrent requests/responses, thus greatly reducing the number of real TCP/IP connections on server side, from 2..8 per client to 1, and allowing many more clients to be served at once.\n\n^ In 2022, HTTP/0.9 support has not been officially completely deprecated and is still present in many web servers and browsers (for server responses only), even if usually disabled. It is unclear how long it will take to decommission HTTP/0.9.\n\n^ Since late 1996, some developers of popular HTTP/1.0 browsers and servers (specially those who had planned support for HTTP/1.1 too), started to deploy (as an unofficial extension) a sort of keep-alive-mechanism (by using new HTTP headers) in order to keep the TCP/IP connection open for more than a request/response pair and so to speed up the exchange of multiple requests/responses.[30]\n\n^ a b HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 have a different representation for HTTP methods and headers.\n\n^ HTTP/1.0 has the same messages except for a few missing headers.\n\n^ HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 use the same request / response mechanism but with different representations for HTTP headers.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n R.

In 1985, the Rajiv Gandhi government changed its name to the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), and with the newly drafted \"National Education Policy 2020\" by the Narendra Modi government, the Ministry of Human Resource Development was renamed back to the Ministry of Education.[5]\n\n\nPolicy[edit]\nSee also: National Policy on Education\nThe new National Education Policy 2020 was passed on 29 July 2020 by the Union Council of Ministers. The NEP 2020 replaced the existing National Policy on Education 1986.[6] Under the NEP 2020, the name of the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD) was changed to Ministry of Education (MoE). Numerous new educational institutes, bodies and concepts were legislated under NEP 2020.[7]\n\nDepartment of School Education and Literacy[edit]\nThe Department of School Education and Literacy is responsible for the development of school education and literacy in the country.\n\nCentral Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)\nCentral Tibetan School Administration (CTSA)\nKendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS)\nNational Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nNational Council for Teacher Education (NCTE)\nNational Foundation for Teachers' Welfare\nNational Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS)\nNavodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS)\nEklavya Model Residential School (EMRS)\nBharatiya Shiksha Board (BSB)\nDepartment of Higher Education[edit]\nMain article: Department of Higher Education (India)\nThe Department of Higher Education is in charge of secondary and post-secondary education. The department is empowered to grant deemed university status to educational institutions on the advice of the University Grants Commission (UGC) of India, under Section 3 of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act, 1956.[8][9][10] The Department of Higher Education takes care of one of the largest higher education systems of the world, just after the United States and China. The department is engaged in bringing world-class opportunities for higher education and research to the country so that Indian students are not found lacking when facing an international platform. For this, the government has launched joint ventures and signed MoUs to help the Indian students benefit from world opinion. The technical education system in the country can be broadly classified into three categories – Central Government-funded institutions, State Government/State-funded institutions and Self-financed institutions.

        "content": "Recurring price business model\nThis article possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. (June 2020) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\n\"Subscription\" redirects here. For the subscription process for shares etc., see Subscription (finance). For its use in religion, see Confessional subscription.\nThe subscription business model is a business model in which a customer must pay a recurring price at regular intervals for access to a product or service. The model was pioneered by publishers of books and periodicals in the 17th century.[1] It is particularly common now for digital products, which lend themselves more naturally toward a subscription model.[2]\nSubscriptions can be a more convenient, hassle-free transaction for consumers.[2] However, due to inertia among some consumers, they may inadvertently pay for subscriptions that they no longer value because they do not realize that they are subscribed.[2]\n\n\nSubscriptions[edit]\nRather than selling products individually, a subscription offers periodic (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, semi-annual, yearly/annual, or seasonal) use or access to a product or service, or, in the case of performance-oriented organizations such as opera companies, tickets to the entire run of some set number of (e.g., five to fifteen) scheduled performances for a whole season. Thus, a one-time sale of a product can become a recurring sale and build brand loyalty.[3]\nIndustries that use this model include mail order book sales clubs and music sales clubs, private web mail providers, cable television, satellite television providers with pay television channels, providers with digital catalogs with downloadable music or eBooks, audiobooks, satellite radio, telephone companies, mobile network operators, internet providers, software publishers, websites (e.g., blogging websites), business solutions providers, financial firms, health clubs, lawn mowing and snowplowing services, pharmaceuticals, renting an apartment, property taxes, as well as the traditional newspapers, magazines, and academic journals.\nRenewal of a subscription may be periodic and activated automatically so that the cost of a new period is automatically paid for by a pre-authorized charge to a credit card or a checking account. A common variation of the model in online games and on websites is the freemium model, in which the first tier of content is free. Still, access to premium features (for example, game power-ups or article archives) is limited to paying subscribers.[4]\nIn addition to the freemium model, other subscription pricing variations are gaining traction. For instance, the tiered pricing model is frequently used in software as a service (SaaS) platforms, offering customers different access levels and features based on their subscription tier. This model is particularly effective for tailoring services to customer requirements. Another approach is the usage-based pricing model, which calculates charges based on the extent of service or product utilization by the customer. This model is becoming increasingly prevalent, especially in services where customer usage varies significantly.[5]\n\nTypes and examples[edit]\nThere are different categories of subscriptions:\n\nA subscription for a fixed set of goods or services.\nPeriodicals, such as a newspaper or magazine, have several types of subscriptions:\nPaid circulation\nNon-paid circulation\nControlled circulation\nSubscription boxes contain a variety of consumables\nCommunity-supported agriculture\nMeal delivery service\nMeal kit delivery service\nA subscription for unlimited use of a service or collection of services. Usage may be personal and non-transferable for a family or, under certain circumstances, for a group utilizing a service simultaneously. In the publishing industry, a subscription to a bundle of several journals, at a discounted price, is known as a \"big deal\".[6]\nSoftware as a service\nA pay-as-you-go subscription where a consumer subscribes to purchase a product periodically. This is also known as the convenience model because it is convenient for the customer not to have to remember to find their product and buy it periodically. This model has been popularized by companies like Dollar Shave Club, Birchbox, and OrderGroove. Based on their success, many other retailers have begun to offer subscription model services.[7]\nFor example, a company's subscription to a rail pass may not be individualized but might permit all firm employees to use the service. Subscriptions of this type are rare for goods with an unlimited supply and many luxury services.\nA subscription for basic access or minimal service plus some additional charge depending on usage. A basic telephone service pays a pre-determined fee for monthly use. Still, it may have extra charges for other services such as long-distance calls, directory, and pay-per-call services. When the basic service is offered free of charge, this business model is often referred to as Freemium.\nAn online subscription supports content creators using crowdfunding. Fans can interact and send tips to the content creator but also have access to exclusive paid content. Popular examples are Patreon and OnlyFans.\nPublishing[edit]\nIn publishing, the subscription model typically involves a paywall, paysite, or other \"toll-access\" system (named in opposition to open access). As revenues from digital advertising diminish, a paid subscription model is being favoured by more publishers who see it as a comparatively stable income stream.[8]\n\nAcademic journals[edit]\nSee also: Big deal (subscription model)\nIn the field of academic publishing, the subscription business model means that articles of a specific journal or conference proceedings are only available to subscribers. Subscriptions are typically sold to universities and other higher education institutions and research institutes, though some academic publishers also sell individual subscriptions or access to individual articles.\nIn contrast with other media such as newspapers, subscription fees to academic publishers generally do not go towards supporting the creation of the content: the scientific articles are written by scientists and reviewed by other scientists as part of their work duties. The publisher does not pay the paper authors and reviewers. In this light, the subscription model has been called undesirable by proponents of the open access movement.\nAcademic publications that use the subscription model are called \"closed-access\" in opposition to their open-access counterparts.\n\nEffects[edit]\nVendors[edit]\nBusinesses benefit because they are assured a predictable and constant revenue stream from subscribed individuals for the duration of the subscriber's agreement. Not only does this greatly reduce uncertainty and the riskiness of the enterprise, but it often provides payment in advance (as with magazines, and concert tickets), while allowing customers to become greatly attached to using the service and, therefore, more likely to extend by signing an agreement for the next period close to when the current agreement expires.[3]\nIn an integrated software solution, for example, the subscription pricing structure is designed so that the revenue stream from the recurring subscriptions is considerably more significant than the revenue from simple one-time purchases. Some subscription schemes (like magazines) also increase sales by not allowing subscribers to accept or reject any specific issue. This reduces customer acquisition costs and allows personalized marketing or database marketing. However, the system requires that the business have an accurate, reliable, and timely way to manage and track subscriptions.\nFrom a marketing-analyst perspective, the vendor has the added benefit of knowing the number of currently active members since a subscription typically involves a contractual agreement. This so-called 'contractual' setting facilitates customer relationship management to a large extent because the analyst knows who is an active customer and who recently churned.[9]\nAdditional benefits include a higher average customer lifetime value (ACLV) than that of nonrecurring business models, greater customer inertia and a more committed customer base as it transitions from purchase to opt-out decisions, and more potential for upselling and cross-selling other products or services.[10]\nSome software companies such as Adobe and Autodesk have moved from a perpetual licensing model to a subscription model, known as \"software as a service\". This move has significant implications for sales and customer support organizations. Over time, the need to close large deals decreases, resulting in lower sales costs. However, the size of the customer support organization increases so that the paying customers stay happy.[11]\n\nCustomers[edit]\nConsumers may find subscriptions convenient if they believe they will buy a product regularly and might save money. The customer saves time for repeated delivery of the product or service.[3]\nSubscriptions which exist to support clubs and organizations call their subscribers \"members\" and they are given access to a group with similar interests.[3]\nSubscription pricing can make it easier to pay for expensive items since they can often be paid for over time and thus can make the product seem more affordable. On the other hand, most newspaper and magazine-type subscriptions are paid upfront, which may prevent some customers from subscribing. Fixed prices may be an advantage for consumers who frequently use those services. However, it could disadvantage a customer who plans to use the service frequently but later does not. The commitment to paying for a package may have been more expensive than a single purchase. In addition, subscription models increase the possibility of vendor lock-in, which can have fatally business-critical implications for a customer if its business depends on the availability of software: For example, without an online connection to a licensing server to verify the licensing status every once in a while, a software under a subscription-model would typically stop functioning or fall back to the functionality of a freemium version, thereby making it impossible (to continue) to use the software in remote places or particularly secure environments without internet access, after the vendor has stopped supporting the version or software, or even has gone out of business leaving the customer without a chance to renew the subscription and access his data or designs maintained with the software (in some businesses it is important to have full access even to old files for decades). Also, consumers may find repeated payments to be onerous.[3]\nSubscription models often require or allow the business to gather substantial amounts of information from the customer (such as magazine mailing lists), and this raises issues of privacy.[3]\nA subscription model may benefit the software buyer if it forces the supplier to improve its product. Accordingly, a psychological phenomenon may occur when a customer renews a subscription, that may not occur during a one-time transaction: if the buyer is not satisfied with the service, he/she can leave the subscription to expire and find another seller.[12]\n\nEnvironment[edit]\nBecause customers may only need or want some of the items received, this can lead to waste and an adverse effect on the environment, depending on the products. Greater volumes of production, greater energy and natural resource consumption, and subsequently greater disposal costs are incurred.[citation needed]\nSubscription models also create the opposite effect. This can be illustrated by subscribing to a service for mowing lawns. The effective use of a single mower increases when mowing for a collection of homes; instead of every family owning a lawnmower that is not used as much as the service-providing mower, the use of resources for producing lawnmowers, therefore, decreases while lawns stay cut.[citation needed]\n\nSee also[edit]\nPayment system\nIndex of accounting articles\nOutline of economics\nList of financial accounting topics\nOutline of marketing\nRent-seeking\nPay to play\nSocial media, subscribing to a social media account/profile is usually free\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Clapp, Sarah L.

        "content": "Lesser divinity or personified abstract concept in classical Greek mythology\nThis article is about the semi-divine beings of Classical Greek mythology. For the evil spirits, see Demon. For other uses, see Demon (disambiguation) (includes daemon disambiguation) or Daimon (disambiguation).\nA request that this article title be changed to DaimonDaimon is under discussion. Please do not move this article until the discussion is closed.\nTwo Minoan Genius performing a libation over an altar\nThe daimon (δαίμων), also spelled daemon (meaning \"god\", \"godlike\", \"power\", \"fate\"),[1][2] denotes an \"unknown superfactor\", which can be either good or hostile.[3]\nIn ancient Greek religion and mythology a daimon was imagined to be a lesser deity or guiding spirit.[4] The word is derived from Proto-Indo-European daimon \"provider, divider (of fortunes or destinies),\" from the root *da- \"to divide\".[5] Daimons were possibly seen as the souls of men of the golden age, tutelary deities, or the forces of fate.[6]\n\n\nDescription[edit]\nSee also: Tutelary deity § Near East and Mediterranean\nDaimons are lesser divinities or spirits, often personifications of abstract concepts, beings of the same nature as both mortals and deities, similar to ghosts, chthonic heroes, spirit guides, forces of nature, or the deities themselves (see Plato's Symposium). According to Hesiod's myth, \"great and powerful figures were to be honoured after death as a daimon…\"[7] A daimon is not so much a type of quasi-divine being, according to Walter Burkert, but rather a non-personified \"peculiar mode\" of their activity.[citation needed]\nIn Hesiod's Theogony, Phaëton becomes an incorporeal daimon or a divine spirit,[8] but, for example, the ills released by Pandora are deadly deities, keres, not daimones.[7] From Hesiod also, the people of the Golden Age were transformed into daimones by the will of Zeus, to serve mortals benevolently as their guardian spirits; \"good beings who dispense riches…[nevertheless], they remain invisible, known only by their acts\".[9] The daimones of venerated heroes were localized by the construction of shrines, so as not to wander restlessly, and were believed to confer protection and good fortune on those offering their respects.[7]\nOne tradition of Greek thought, which found agreement in the mind of Plato, was of a daimon which existed within a person from their birth, and that each individual was obtained by a singular daimon prior to their birth by way of lot.[7]\n\nIn mythology[edit]\nHomer's use of the words theoí (θεοί, \"gods\") and daímones (δαίμονες) suggests that, while distinct, they are similar in kind.[10] Later writers developed the distinction between the two.[11] Plato in Cratylus[12] speculates that the word daimōn (δαίμων, \"deity\") is synonymous to daēmōn (δαήμων, \"knowing or wise\");[13] however, it is more probably daiō (δαίω, \"to divide, to distribute destinies, to allot\").[14]\n\nSocrates[edit]\nMain article: Daimonion (Socrates)\nSocrates with Alcibiades and the Daimonion. Oil painting by François-André Vincent, 1776, in the Musée Fabre, Montpellier\nIn Plato's Symposium, the priestess Diotima teaches Socrates that love is not a deity, but rather a \"great daimōn\" (202d). She goes on to explain that \"everything daimōnion is between divine and mortal\" (202d–e), and she describes daimōns as \"interpreting and transporting human things to the gods and divine things to men; entreaties and sacrifices from below, and ordinances and requitals from above...\" (202e). In Plato's Apology of Socrates, Socrates claimed to have a daimōnion (literally, a \"divine something\")[15] that frequently warned him—in the form of a \"voice\"—against mistakes but never told him what to do.[16] The Platonic Socrates, however, never refers to the daimonion as a daimōn; it was always referred to as an impersonal \"something\" or \"sign\".[17] By this term he seems to indicate the true nature of the human soul, his newfound self-consciousness.[18] Paul Shorey sees the daimonion not as an inspiration but as \"a kind of spiritual tact checking Socrates from any act opposed to his true moral and intellectual interests.\"[19]\nRegarding the charge brought against Socrates in 399 BC, Plato surmised \"Socrates does wrong because he does not believe in the gods in whom the city believes, but introduces other daemonic beings...\" Burkert notes that \"a special being watches over each individual, a daimōn who has obtained the person at his birth by lot, is an idea which we find in Plato, undoubtedly from earlier tradition. The famous, paradoxical saying of Heraclitus is already directed against such a view: 'character is for man his daimon'\".[7]\n\nCategories[edit]\nThis article contains too many or overly lengthy quotations. Please help summarise the quotations. Consider transferring direct quotations to Wikiquote or excerpts to Wikisource. (June 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nWinged genius facing a woman with a tambourine and mirror, from southern Italy, about 320 BC\nThe Hellenistic Greeks divided daemons into good and evil categories: agathodaímōn (ἀγαθοδαίμων, \"noble spirit\"), from agathós (ἀγαθός, \"good, brave, noble, moral, lucky, useful\"), and kakodaímōn (κακοδαίμων, \"malevolent spirit\"), from kakós (κακός, \"bad, evil\"). They resemble the Arabic jinni (or genie), and in their humble efforts to help mediate the good and ill fortunes of human life, they resemble the Christian guardian angel and adversarial demon, respectively. Eudaimonia (εὐδαιμονία) came to mean \"well-being\" or \"happiness\". The comparable Roman concept is the genius who accompanies and protects a person or presides over a place (see genius loci).\n\nA distorted view of Homer's daemon results from an anachronistic reading in light of later characterizations by Plato and Xenocrates, his successor as head of the Academy, who saw the daemon as a potentially dangerous lesser spirit:[7][20] Burkert states that in the Symposium, Plato has \"laid the foundation\" to imagine the daimon as being with Eros, who as a mediator is neither god nor mortal but in between. His metaphysical doctrine of an \nincorporeal, pure actuality, energeia ... identical to its performance: ‘thinking of thinking’, noesis noeseos is the most blessed existence, the highest origin of everything. ‘This is the god. On such a principle heaven depends, and the cosmos.’ \n\nIn the monotheism of the mind, philosophical speculation has reached an end-point. ... In Plato there is an incipient tendency toward the apotheosis of nous. ... He needs a closeness and availability of the divine that is offered neither by the stars nor by metaphysical principles. Here a name emerged to fill the gap, a name which had always designated the incomprehensible yet present activity of a higher power, daimon.[7]\n\n Daemons scarcely figure in Greek mythology or Greek art: they are felt, but their unseen presence can only be presumed,[citation needed]. The exception is the agathodaemon, honored in ceremonial wine-drinking --especially at the sanctuary of Dionysus-- and represented in iconography by the chthonic serpent.\nBurkert suggests that, for Plato, theology rests on two Forms: the Good and the Simple; which \"Xenocrates unequivocally called the unity god\" in sharp contrast to the poet's gods of epic and tragedy.[7] Although much like the deities, these figures were not always depicted without considerable moral ambiguity: \n Indeed, Xenocrates ... explicitly understood daemones as ranged along a scale from good to bad. ... [Plutarch] speaks of ‘great and strong beings in the atmosphere, malevolent and morose, who rejoice in [unlucky days, religious festivals involving violence against the self, etc.], and after gaining them as their lot, they turn to nothing worse.’ ... Quite when the point was first made remains unanswerable. Much the same thought as [Plato's] is to be found in a late Hellenistic composition, the Pythagorean Commentaries, which draws on older popular representations: ‘The whole air is full of souls. We call them daemones and heroes, and it is they who send dreams, signs and illnesses to men; and not only men, but also to sheep and other domestic animals. It is towards these daemones that we direct purifications and apotropaic rites, all kinds of divination, the art of reading chance utterances, and so on.’ ... This account differs from that of the early Academy in reaching back to the other, Archaic, view of daemones as souls, and thus anticipates the views of Plutarch and Apuleius in the Principate ... It clearly implies that daemones can cause illness to livestock: this traditional dominated view has now reached the intellectuals.[21]\n\n\nIn the Archaic or early Classical period, the daimon had been democratized and internalized for each person, whom it served to guide, motivate, and inspire, as one possessed of such good spirits.[citation needed] Similarly, the first-century Roman imperial cult began by venerating the genius or numen of Augustus, a distinction that blurred in time.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nAnito\nAnthelioi\nEudaimon\nFravashi\nFylgja\nHis Dark Materials\nHyang\nKami\nKoalemos\nMoral imperative\nShoulder angel\nUnclean spirit\nXian (Taoism)\nYaksha\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ A.

        "content": "Media that can reach a large audience via mass communication\n\"Mass Media\" redirects here. For the video game company, see Mass Media (company).\n\n\nThis article includes a list of references, related reading, or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please help improve this article by introducing more precise citations. (August 2025) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nMass media refers to the forms of media that reach large audiences via mass communication. It includes broadcast media, digital media, print media, social media, streaming media, advertising, and events.[1][2][3]\nMass media encompasses news, advocacy, entertainment, and public service announcements, and intersects with the study of marketing, propaganda, public relations, political communication, journalism, art, drama, computing, and technology. The influence of mass media on individuals and groups has also been analysed from the standpoint of anthropology, economics, history, law, philosophy, psychology, and sociology.\nMass media is often controlled by media conglomerates, which may include mass media organisations, companies, and networks, and may be subject to media capture.[4][5]\n\n\nDefinition[edit]\nIn the late 20th century, mass media could be classified into eight mass media industries: books, the Internet, magazines, movies, newspapers, radio, recordings, and television. The explosion of digital communication technology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries challenged this classification. By the early 2000s, a classification called the \"seven mass media\" came into use, comprising:[6]\n\nPrint (books, pamphlets, newspapers, magazines, posters, etc.) - late 15th century\nRecordings (gramophone records, magnetic tapes, cassettes, cartridges, CDs , and DVDs) - late 19th century\nCinema - c. 1900\nRadio - c. 1910\nTelevision - c. 1950\nThe Internet - c. 1990\nMobile phones - c. 2000\nThe sixth and seventh media, Internet and mobile phones, are often referred to collectively as digital media, and the fourth and fifth, radio and TV, as broadcast media.[1][2][3] Some argue that video games have developed into a distinct mass form of media.[7]\n\nCharacteristics[edit]\nFive characteristics of mass communication have been identified by sociologist John Thompson of Cambridge University:[8]\n\n\"Comprises both technical and institutional methods of production and distribution\".[clarification needed]\nInvolves the \"commodification of symbolic forms\"[clarification needed]\n\"Separate contexts between the production and reception of information\"[clarification needed]\nIts \"reach to those 'far removed' in time and space, in comparison to the producers\"[clarification needed]\n\"Information distribution\" – a \"one-to-many\" form of communication, whereby products are mass-produced and disseminated to large audiences\nMainstream media[edit]\nIn common usage, the term \"mass\" denotes not that a given number of individuals receives the products, but rather that the products are available in principle to a plurality of recipients.[8] The term \"mass media\" is sometimes used as a synonym for \"mainstream media\". However, mass media may include alternative media outlets that employ mass communication technology, even if their audience is smaller than mainstream media. In contrast, mainstream media are distinguished from alternative media by their content and point of view.[citation needed]\n\nHistory[edit]\nEarly wooden printing press, depicted in 1520\nThe first dated printed book known is the \"Diamond Sutra\", printed in China in 868 AD, although it is clear that books were printed earlier. Movable clay type was invented in 1041 in China. However, due to the slow spread of literacy to the masses in China, and the relatively high cost of paper there, the earliest printed mass medium was probably European popular prints from about 1400. Although these were produced in huge numbers, very few early examples survive, and even most known to be printed before about 1600 have not survived. The term \"mass media\" was coined with the creation of print media, which is notable for being the first example of mass media, as we use the term today. This form of media started in Europe in the Middle Ages.\nJohannes Gutenberg's invention of the printing press allowed the mass production of books to sweep the nation. He printed the first book, a Latin Bible, on a printing press with movable type in 1453. The invention of the printing press gave rise to some of the first forms of mass communication by enabling the publication of books and newspapers on a scale much larger than was previously possible.[9][10][11] The invention also transformed the way the world received printed materials, although books remained too expensive really to be called a mass medium for at least a century after that. Newspapers developed from about 1612, with the first example in English in 1620;[12] but they took until the 19th century to reach a mass audience directly. The first high-circulation newspapers arose in London in the early 1800s, such as The Times, and were made possible by the invention of high-speed rotary steam printing presses, and railroads which allowed large-scale distribution over wide geographical areas. The increase in circulation, however, led to a decline in feedback and interactivity from the readership, making newspapers a more one-way medium.[13][14][15][16]\nThe phrase \"the media\" began to be used in the 1920s.[17] The notion of \"mass media\" was generally restricted to print media up until the post-Second World War, when radio, television and video were introduced. The audio-visual facilities became very popular, because they provided both information and entertainment, because the colour and sound engaged the viewers/listeners and because it was easier for the general public to passively watch TV or listen to the radio than to actively read. \nDuring the 20th century, the growth of mass media was driven by technology, including that which allowed much duplication of material. Physical duplication technologies such as printing, record pressing and film duplication allowed the duplication of books, newspapers and movies at low prices to huge audiences. Radio and television allowed the electronic duplication of information for the first time. Mass media had the economics of linear replication: a single work could make money. Proportional to the number of copies sold, and as volumes went up, unit costs went down, increasing profit margins further. Vast fortunes were made in mass media. In a democratic society, the media can serve the electorate about issues regarding government and corporate entities. Some consider the concentration of media ownership to be a threat to democracy.[18]\nIn recent times, the Internet has become the latest and most popular mass medium. Information has become readily available through websites, and easily accessible through search engines. Modern-day mass media includes the internet, mobile phones, blogs, podcasts and RSS feeds.[19]\n\nMergers and acquisitions[edit]\nBetween 1985 and 2018, about 76,720 deals have been announced in the media industry. This sums up to an overall value of around US$5,634 billion.[20] There have been three major waves of M&A in the mass media sector (2000, 2007 and 2015), while the most active year in terms of numbers was 2007 with around 3,808 deals. The United States is the most prominent country in media M&A with 41 of the top 50 deals having an acquirer from the United States.\nThe largest deal in history was the acquisition of Time Warner by AOL Inc. for US$164,746.86 million.\n\nInfluence and sociology[edit]\nMain article: Influence of mass media\nIn 1997, J. R. Finnegan Jr. and K. Viswanath identified three main effects or functions of mass media.\nFirst, The Knowledge Gap: the mass media influences knowledge gaps due to factors including \"the extent to which the content is appealing, the degree to which information channels are accessible and desirable, and the amount of social conflict and diversity there is in a community\".\nSecond, Agenda Setting: people are influenced in how they think about issues due to the selective nature of what media groups choose for public consumption. J. J. Davis states that \"when risks are highlighted in the media, particularly in great detail, the extent of agenda setting is likely to be based on the degree to which a public sense of outrage and threat is provoked\". When wanting to set an agenda, framing can be invaluably useful to a mass media organisation. Framing involves \"taking a leadership role in the organisation of public discourse about an issue\". The media is influenced by the desire for balance in coverage, and the resulting pressures can come from groups with particular political action and advocacy positions. Finnegan and Viswanath say, \"groups, institutions and advocates compete to identify problems, to move them onto the public agenda, and to define the issues symbolically\" (1997, p. 324).\nThird, Cultivation of Perceptions: the extent to which media exposure shapes audience perceptions over time is known as cultivation. Television is a common experience, especially in places like the United States, to the point where it can be described as a \"homogenising agent\" (S. W. Littlejohn). However, instead of being merely a result of the TV, the effect is often based on socioeconomic factors. Having a prolonged exposure to TV or movie violence might affect a viewer to the extent where they actively think community violence is a problem, or alternatively find it justifiable. The resulting belief is likely to be different depending on where people live, however.[1]\nSince the 1950s, when cinema, radio and TV began to be the primary or only source of information for most of the population, these media became the central instruments of mass control.[21][22] When a country reaches a high level of industrialisation, the country itself \"belongs to the person who controls communications\".[23]\nMass media play a significant role in shaping public perceptions on a variety of important issues, both through the information that is dispensed through them, and through the interpretations they place upon this information.[21] They also play a large role in shaping modern culture, by selecting and portraying a particular set of beliefs, values and traditions (an entire way of life), as reality. That is, by portraying a certain interpretation of reality, they shape reality to be more in line with that interpretation.[22] Mass media also play a crucial role in the spread of civil unrest activities such as anti-government demonstrations, riots and general strikes.[24] That is, the use of radio and television receivers has made the unrest influence among cities not only by the geographic location of cities, but also by proximity within the mass media distribution networks.[24]\nMedia artist Joey Skaggs has demonstrated the ease with which mass media can be manipulated using fabricated press releases, staged events, and fictitious experts. His long-running series of media hoaxes reveal how news outlets can be drawn to sensational narratives, often publishing stories with minimal fact-checking. Skaggs' work has been cited as a critique of journalistic practices and a case study in the vulnerabilities of modern media systems.[25]\nLimited-effects theory theorizes that because people usually choose what media to interact with based on what they already believe, media exerts a negligible influence. Class-dominant theory argues that the media reflects and projects the view of a minority elite, which controls it. Culturalist theory combines the other two theories and claims people interact with media to create their own meanings out of the images and messages they receive. In 2012, an article asserted that 90 percent of US mass media—including radio, video news, sports entertainment, and other—were owned by six major companies (GE, News-Corp, Disney, Viacom, Time Warner and CBS).[26]\n\nRacism and stereotyping[edit]\nFurther information: Stereotype\nA magazine feature from Beauty Parade from 1952 stereotyping women drivers. It features Bettie Page.\nAmerican political cartoon titled The Usual Irish Way of Doing Things, depicting a drunken Irishman lighting a powder keg and swinging a bottle. Harper's Weekly, 1871.Mass media sources, through framing and agenda-setting, can affect the impact of a story, as particular facts and information can be highlighted (media influence). This can correlate with how individuals perceive certain groups of people, as the media coverage a person receives can be limited and may not reflect the whole story or situation. Stories are often covered to reflect a particular perspective, sometimes to target a specific demographic.[27] Mass media, as well as propaganda, can reinforce or introduce stereotypes to the general public.[28]\nOne example is how mass media has played a large role in the way white Americans perceive African Americans. Historical media focus on African Americans in the contexts of crime, drug use, gang violence and other forms of anti-social behavior has resulted in a distorted and harmful public perception of African Americans.[29] In his article \"Mass Media and Racism\", Stephen Balkaran states: \"The media has played a key role in perpetuating the effects of this historical oppression and in contributing to African Americans' continuing status as second-class citizens.\" This has resulted in uncertainty among some white Americans as to what the genuine nature of African Americans is.[29]\n\nEthical issues and criticism[edit]\nLack of local or specific topic focus is a common criticism of mass media. A mass news media outlet often chooses to cover national and international news due to it having to cater for and be relevant for a wide demographic. As such, it can skip over many interesting or important local stories because they simply do not interest the large majority of their viewers.\nThe term \"mass\" suggests that the recipients of media products constitute a vast sea of passive, undifferentiated individuals. This is an image associated with some earlier critiques of \"mass culture\" and mass society , which generally assumed that the development of mass communication has had a largely negative impact on modern social life, creating a kind of bland and homogeneous culture which entertains individuals without challenging them.[8] However, interactive digital media have also been seen to challenge the read-only paradigm of earlier broadcast media.[8]\nSince the 1950s, in the countries that have reached a high level of industrialisation, the mass media of cinema, radio and TV have a key role in political power.[23] Media bias on a particular topic can be assessed in comparison to the median voter.[30]\nContemporary research demonstrates an increasing level of concentration of media ownership, with many media industries already highly concentrated and dominated by a small number of firms.[31]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nWhen the study of mass media began the media was compiled of only mass media which is a very different media system than the social media empire of the 21st-century experiences.[32] With this in mind, there are critiques that mass media no longer exists, or at least that it does not exist in the same form as it once did. This original form of mass media put filters on what the general public would be exposed to in regards to \"news\" something that is harder to do in a society of social media.[33]\nTheorist Lance Bennett explains that excluding a few major events in recent history, it is uncommon for a group big enough to be labeled a mass, to be watching the same news via the same medium of mass production.[34] Bennett's critique of 21st-century mass media argues that today it is more common for a group of people to be receiving different news stories, from completely different sources, and thus, mass media has been re-invented. As discussed above, filters would have been applied to original mass medias when the journalists decided what would or would not be printed.\nSocial media is a large contributor to the change from mass media to a new paradigm because through social media what is mass communication and what is interpersonal communication is confused.[35].\nDue to the widespread use of social media and the rapid development of information technology, the media landscape has undergone significant changes. As a result, the Hallin and Mancini media model, based on traditional indicators, no longer fully aligns with today’s media ecosystem. While television continues to target a more mature audience and uphold professional journalism standards, digital journalism and social media tend to adapt those standards to align more closely with audience preferences.[36]\n\nForms[edit]\nBroadcast media[edit]\nMain articles: Radio broadcasting and Television\nA family listening to a crystal radio in the 1920s\nBroadcast media includes radio and radio and television programs. Television includes cable television, which may require a cable converter box, and generally includes subscription-based channels and pay-per-view services. Digital radio and digital television may also transmit multiplexed programming, with several channels compressed into one ensemble. Broadcast regulations,[1] programming, and terminology have emerged as independent fields of inquiry. When broadcasting is done via the Internet, the term webcasting is often used. In 2004, a new phenomenon occurred when a number of technologies combined to produce podcasting.\n\nFilm[edit]\nMain article: Film\nThe term 'film' encompasses motion pictures as individual projects, as well as the field in general. The name comes from the photographic film (also called film stock), historically the primary medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms for film exist, such as motion pictures (or just pictures and \"picture\"), the silver screen, photoplays, the cinema, picture shows, flicks and, most commonly, movies.[37]\nFilms are produced by recording people and objects with cameras, or by creating them using animation techniques or special effects. Films comprise a series of individual frames, but when these images are shown in rapid succession, an illusion of motion is created. Flickering between frames is not seen because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after the source has been removed. Also of relevance is what causes the perception of motion: a psychological effect identified as beta movement.\n\nVideo games[edit]\nMain article: Video game\nShopping carts for children fitted with gaming computers\nA video game is a computer-controlled game in which a video display, such as a monitor or television set, is the primary feedback device. There must also be some sort of input device, usually in the form of button/joystick combinations, a keyboard and mouse combination, a controller, or a player's motion.\n\nAudio recording and reproduction[edit]\nSound recording and reproduction is the electrical or mechanical re-creation or amplification of sound, often as music. This involves the use of audio equipment such as microphones, recording devices and loudspeakers. From early beginnings, with the invention of the phonograph using purely mechanical techniques, the field has advanced with the invention of electrical recording, the mass production of the 78 record, the magnetic wire recorder followed by the tape recorder, and the vinyl LP record. The invention of the compact cassette in the 1960s, followed by Sony's Walkman, gave a major boost to the mass distribution of music recordings, and the invention of digital recording and the compact disc in 1983 brought massive improvements in ruggedness and quality.\n\nInternet media[edit]\nSee also: Digital media and New media\nThe Internet is a more interactive medium of mass media, and can be briefly described as \"a network of networks\". Specifically, it is the worldwide, publicly accessible network of interconnected computer networks that transmit data by packet switching using the standard Internet Protocol (IP). It consists of millions of smaller domestic, academic, business and governmental networks, which together carry various information and services, such as email, online chat, file transfer, and the interlinked web pages and other documents of the World Wide Web.\nThe Internet is the system of interconnected computer networks, linked by copper wires, fibre-optic cables, and wireless connections, while the Web is the contents of the internet linked by hyperlinks and URLs. The World Wide Web is accessible through the Internet, along with many other services including e-mail, file sharing and others described below.\nToward the end of the 20th century, the advent of the World Wide Web marked the first era in which most individuals could have a means of exposure on a scale comparable to that of mass media. Forms of internet media include blogs, microblogs, RSS feeds, and podcasts.\n\nMobile[edit]\nMain article: Mobile media\nMobile phones were introduced in Japan in 1979 but became a mass media only in 1998 when the first downloadable ringing tones were introduced in Finland. Soon most forms of media content were introduced on mobile phones, tablets and other portable device. Similar to the internet, mobile is also an interactive media.\n\nPrint media[edit]\nSee also: Publishing § Industry sub-divisions, and Printing\nMagazine[edit]\nMain article: Magazine\nActress Mervat Amin on the cover for Al-Mawwid magazine, June 1972\nA magazine is a periodical publication containing a variety of articles, generally financed by advertising or purchase by readers. Magazines are typically published weekly, biweekly, monthly, bimonthly or quarterly, with a date on the cover that is in advance of the date it is actually published. They are often printed in colour on coated paper, and are bound with a soft cover.\n\nNewspaper[edit]\nMain article: Newspaper\nA panel in the Newseum in Washington, D.C., showing newspaper headlines from the day after 9/11 \nA newspaper is a publication containing news, information, and advertising, usually printed on low-cost paper called newsprint. It may be general or special interest, and is usually published serially, most often daily or weekly. The dominant function of newspapers is to inform the public of significant events.[38] Newspapers originated after the invention and spread of the printing press by Johann Gutenberg around 1450, with the first newspaper being the German-language Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien, first published in 1605. The increasing prevalence of internet-based news media has, while challenging newspapers as an alternative source of information and opinion, has also provided a new platform for mass media organisations to reach new audiences.[39] As such, in the twenty-first century, newspaper circulation has fallen in almost all regions.[40]\n\nOutdoor media[edit]\nPolitical advertisements on a billboard in the Netherlands in 2019\nOutdoor media is a form of mass media which comprises billboards, signs, placards, flying billboards, blimps, skywriting, and augmented reality advertising. Many commercial advertisers use this form of mass media when advertising in sports stadiums.\n\nProfessions[edit]\nJournalism[edit]\nJournalism is the discipline of collecting, analyzing, verifying and presenting information regarding current events, trends, issues and people.Copy of a newspaper (El Universo), an example of mass media\nPublic relations[edit]\nPublic relations is management of communication between an organisation and its key publics to build, manage and sustain its positive image. \n\nPublishing[edit]\nA member of staff at the International Printing Museum demonstrates printing with a 19th-century, hand-operated Columbian press.Publishing is the industry concerned with the production of literature or information – the activity of making information available for public view. In some cases, authors may be their own publishers. Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works such as books and newspapers. With the advent of digital information systems and the Internet, the scope of publishing has expanded to include websites, blogs and the like.\nSoftware publishing[edit]\nA software publisher is a publishing company in the software industry between the developer and the distributor. In some companies, two or all three of these roles may be combined (and indeed, may reside in a single person, especially in the case of shareware).\n\nInternet celebrity[edit]\nAn internet celebrity is anyone who gained fame on the Internet.\n\nSee also[edit]\n\nCommercial broadcasting – Practice of airing radio and television advertisements for profit\nDigital rights management – Technology to control access to copyrighted works and prevent unauthorized copying\nHistory of newspaper publishing\nInternet censorship – Legal control of the internet\nJournalism – Production of reports on current events\nMedia conglomerate – Large company involved in mass media industry\nMedia echo chamber\nMedia economics – Embodies economic theoretical and practical economic questions specific to media of all types\nMedia regulation\nMedia-system dependency\nMediatization (media) – Process whereby the mass media influence other sectors of society\nState media – Media under editorial control of a government\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c d \"Mass Media\". eNotes.com.

        "title": "Funerary art",
        "content": "Art associated with a repository for the remains of the dead\n\n\nTomb of Philippe Pot with life-sized hooded pleurants, c. 1477–80, now in the Louvre, Paris\nKorean tomb mound of King Sejong the Great, d. 1450\nTürbe of Roxelana (d. 1558), Süleymaniye Mosque, Istanbul\nFunerary art is any work of art forming, or placed in, a repository for the remains of the dead. The term encompasses a wide variety of forms, including cenotaphs (\"empty tombs\"), tomb-like monuments which do not contain human remains, and communal memorials to the dead, such as war memorials, which may or may not contain remains, and a range of prehistoric megalithic constructs. Funerary art may serve many cultural functions. It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centred practices of ancestor veneration or as a publicly directed dynastic display.  It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the lives of the living.\nThe deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention is found in almost all cultures – Hindu culture, which has little, is a notable exception.  Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures – from the Egyptian pyramids and the Tutankhamun treasure, to the Terracotta Army surrounding the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, the Sutton Hoo ship burial and the Taj Mahal – are tombs or objects found in and around them.  In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions.\nAn important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the funeral ceremonies.[1] The treasure of the 18th dynasty Pharaoh Tutankhamun, for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again after it was deposited, while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators.  A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures, nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended for later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians.  In these cultures, traditions such as the sculpted sarcophagus and tomb monument of the Greek and Roman empires, and later the Christian world, have flourished. The mausoleum intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in Islamic culture.\n\n\nTerminology[edit]\nTomb is a general term for any repository for human remains, while grave goods are other objects which have been placed within the tomb.[2] Such objects may include the personal possessions of the deceased, objects specially created for the burial, or miniature versions of things believed to be needed in an afterlife.  Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.\nA tumulus, mound, kurgan, or long barrow covered important burials in many cultures, and the body may be placed in a sarcophagus, usually of stone, or a coffin, usually of wood.  A mausoleum is a building erected mainly as a tomb, taking its name from the Mausoleum of Mausolus at Halicarnassus.  Stele is a term for erect stones that are often what are now called gravestones. Ship burials are mostly found in coastal Europe, while chariot burials are found widely across Eurasia. Catacombs, of which the most famous examples are those in Rome and Alexandria, are underground cemeteries connected by tunnelled passages.  A large group of burials with traces remaining above ground can be called a necropolis; if there are no such visible structures, it is a grave field.  A cenotaph is a memorial without a burial.[3]\nThe word \"funerary\" strictly means \"of or pertaining to a funeral or burial\",[4] but there is a long tradition in English of applying it not only to the practices and artefacts directly associated with funeral rites, but also to a wider range of more permanent memorials to the dead. Particularly influential in this regard was John Weever's Ancient Funerall Monuments (1631), the first full-length book to be dedicated to the subject of tomb memorials and epitaphs. More recently, some scholars have challenged the usage: Phillip Lindley, for example, makes a point of referring to \"tomb monuments\", saying \"I have avoided using the term 'funeral monuments' because funeral effigies were, in the Middle Ages, temporary products, made as substitutes for the encoffined corpse for use during the funeral ceremonies\".[5] Others, however, have found this distinction \"rather pedantic\".[6]\nRelated genres of commemorative art for the dead take many forms, such as the moai figures of Easter Island, apparently a type of sculpted ancestor portrait, though hardly individualized.[7] These are common in cultures as diverse as Ancient Rome and China, in both of which they are kept in the houses of the descendants, rather than being buried.[8] Many cultures have psychopomp figures, such as the Greek Hermes and Etruscan Charun, who help conduct the spirits of the dead into the afterlife.\n\nHistory[edit]\nPre-history[edit]\nMain article: Megalith\nThe Neolithic Poulnabrone dolmen in Ireland contains the bodies of at least 22 individuals\nMost of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs.[9] Mostly megalithic, the earliest instances date to within a few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the Iberian peninsula have been dated through thermoluminescence to c. 4510 BCE, and some burials at the Carnac stones in Brittany also date back to the fifth millennium BCE.[10] The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from the earliest, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of ancestor-worship, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.[11]\nIn Neolithic and Bronze Age societies, a great variety of tombs are found, with tumulus mounds, megaliths, and pottery as recurrent elements. In Eurasia, a dolmen is the exposed stone framework for a chamber tomb originally covered by earth to make a mound which no longer exists.  Stones may be carved with geometric patterns (petroglyphs), for example cup and ring marks.  Group tombs were made, the social context of which is hard to decipher. Urn burials, where bones are buried in a pottery container, either in a more elaborate tomb, or by themselves, are widespread, by no means restricted to the Urnfield culture which is named after them, or even to Eurasia.  Menhirs, or \"standing stones\", seem often to mark graves or serve as memorials,[12] while the later runestones and image stones often are cenotaphs, or memorials apart from the grave itself; these continue into the Christian period. The Senegambian stone circles are a later African form of tomb markers.[13]\n\nAncient Egypt and Nubia[edit]\nMain article: Art of ancient Egypt\nEgyptian ceramic coffin mask\nEgyptian funerary art was inseparable to the religious belief that life continued after death and that \"death is a mere phase of life\".[14] Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next,[15] and to \"commemorate the life of the tomb owner ... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's rebirth.\"[16] In this context are the Egyptian mummies encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, and the canopic jars preserving internal organs. A special category of Ancient Egyptian funerary texts clarify the purposes of the burial customs.  The early mastaba type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. A Ka statue effigy of the deceased might be walled up in a serdab connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of incense to reach the effigy.[17] The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with reliefs in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a \"false door\", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to receive the offerings left by the living.[18]\nRepresentational art, such as portraiture of the deceased, is found extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the encaustic Faiyum funerary portraits applied to coffins. However, it is still hotly debated whether there was realistic portraiture in Ancient Egypt.[19] The purpose of the life-sized reserve heads found in burial shafts or tombs of nobles of the Fourth dynasty is not well understood; they may have been a discreet method of eliding an edict by Khufu forbidding nobles from creating statues of themselves, or may have protected the deceased's spirit from harm or magically eliminated any evil in it, or perhaps functioned as alternate containers for the spirit if the body should be harmed in any way.[20]\nArchitectural works such as the massive Great Pyramid and two smaller ones built during the Old Kingdom in the Giza Necropolis and (much later, from about 1500 BCE) the tombs in the Valley of the Kings were built for royalty and the elite. The Theban Necropolis was later an important site for mortuary temples and mastaba tombs.  The Kushite kings who conquered Egypt and ruled as pharaohs during the Twenty-fifth Dynasty were greatly influenced by Egyptian funerary customs, employing mummification, canopic jars and ushabti funerary figurines. They also built the Nubian pyramids, which in both size and design more closely resemble the smaller Seventeenth dynasty pyramids at Thebes than those of the Old Kingdom near Memphis.[21]\nLower-class citizens used common forms of funerary art—including shabti figurines (to perform any labor that might be required of the dead person in the afterlife), models of the scarab beetle and funerary texts—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.[22] During the Middle Kingdom, miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.[23]\n\nAncient Greece[edit]\nRelief from a carved funerary lekythos at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens: Hermes conducts the deceased, Myrrhine, to Hades, c. 430–420 BCE\nDuring the Iron Age, the ancient Greeks did not generally leave elaborate grave goods, except for a coin to pay Charon, the ferryman to Hades, and pottery; however the epitaphios or funeral oration from which the word epitaph comes was regarded as of great importance, and animal sacrifices were made.   Those who could afford them erected stone monuments, which was one of the functions of kouros statues in the Archaic period before about 500 BCE.  These were not intended as portraits, but during the Hellenistic period, realistic portraiture of the deceased was introduced and family groups were often depicted in bas-relief on monuments, usually surrounded by an architectural frame.[24] The walls of tomb chambers were often painted in fresco, although few examples have survived in as good condition as the Tomb of the Diver from southern Italy or the tombs at Vergina in Macedon.  Almost the only surviving painted portraits in the classical Greek tradition are found in Egypt rather than Greece. The Fayum mummy portraits, from the very end of the classical period, were portrait faces, in a Graeco-Roman style, attached to mummies.[25]\nEarly Greek burials were frequently marked above ground by a large piece of pottery, and remains were also buried in urns.  Pottery continued to be used extensively inside tombs and graves throughout the classical period.[26] The great majority of surviving ancient Greek pottery is recovered from tombs; some was apparently items used in life, but much of it was made specifically for placing in tombs, and the balance between the two original purposes is controversial.  The larnax is a small coffin or ash-chest, usually of decorated terracotta. The two-handled loutrophoros was primarily associated with weddings, as it was used to carry water for the nuptial bath. However, it was also placed in the tombs of the unmarried, \"presumably to make up in some way for what they had missed in life.\"[27] The one-handled lekythos had many household uses, but outside the household, its principal use was the decoration of tombs.[28] Scenes of a descent to the underworld of Hades were often painted on these, with the dead depicted beside Hermes, Charon or both—though usually only with Charon.[29] Small pottery figurines are often found, though it is hard to decide if these were made especially for placement in tombs; in the case of the Hellenistic Tanagra figurines, this seems probably not the case.[30] But silverware is more often found around the fringes of the Greek world, as in the royal Macedonian tombs of Vergina, or in the neighbouring cultures such as those of Thrace or the Scythians.[31]\nThe extension of the Greek world after the conquests of Alexander the Great brought peoples with different tomb-making traditions into the Hellenistic sphere, resulting in new formats for art in Greek styles.[32] A generation before Alexander, Mausolus was a Hellenized satrap or semi-independent ruler under the Persian Empire, whose enormous tomb (begun 353 BCE) was wholly exceptional in the Greek world—together with the Pyramids it was the only tomb to be included in the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.  The exact form of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, which gave the name to the form, is now unclear, and there are several alternative reconstructions that seek to reconcile the archaeological evidence with descriptions in literature.[33] It had the size and some elements of the design of the Greek temple, but was much more vertical, with a square base and a pyramidal roof.  There were quantities of large sculpture, of which most of the few surviving pieces are now in the British Museum.[34] Other local rulers adapted the high-relief temple frieze for very large sarcophagi, starting a tradition which was to exert a great influence on Western art up to 18th-century Neo-Classicism.  The late 4th-century Alexander Sarcophagus was in fact made for another Hellenized Eastern ruler, one of a number of important sarcophagi found at Sidon in the modern Lebanon.  The two long sides show Alexander's great victory at the Battle of Issus and a lion hunt; such violent scenes were common on ostentatious classical sarcophagi from this period onwards, with a particular revival in Roman art of the 2nd century.  More peaceful mythological scenes were popular on smaller sarcophagi, especially of Bacchus.[35]\n\nEtruscans[edit]\nThe Etruscan Sarcophagus of the Spouses (late 6th century BCE), at the National Etruscan Museum in Rome\nObjects connected with death, in particular sarcophagi and cinerary urns, form the basis of much of current knowledge of the ancient Etruscan civilization and its art, which once competed with the culture of ancient Rome, but was eventually absorbed into it.[36] The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the mano cornuta to protect the grave.[37]\nThe main subject in the funerary art of the 7th and 6th centuries BCE was typically a feasting scene, sometimes with dancers and musicians, or athletic competitions. Household bowls, cups, and pitchers are sometimes found in the graves, along with food such as eggs, pomegranates, honey, grapes and olives for use in the afterlife.[38][39] From the 5th century, the mood changed to more sombre  scenes of parting, where the deceased are shown leaving their loved ones,[40] often surrounded by underworld demons, and psychopomps, such as Charun or the winged female Vanth. The underworld figures are sometimes depicted as gesturing impatiently for a human to be taken away.[41] The handshake was another common motif, as the dead took leave of the living.[41] This often took place in front of or near a closed double doorway, presumably the portal to the underworld. Evidence in some art, however, suggests that the \"handshake took place at the other end of the journey, and represents the dead being greeted in the Underworld\".[41]\n\nAncient Rome[edit]\nMain article: Roman funerary art\nWarrior with cuirass and helmet leaning on his spear in front of a funerary stele; the snake symbolizes the soul of the dead. Marble, Roman, 1st century BCE, imitating the Greek classical style of the 5th century BCE. From Rhodes.\nThe burial customs of the ancient Romans were influenced by both of the first significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, namely the Greeks of Magna Graecia and the Etruscans.[42] The original Roman custom was cremation, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a columbarium; pre-Roman burials around Rome often used hut-urns—little pottery houses.[43] From about the 2nd century CE, inhumation (burial of unburnt remains) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, became more fashionable for those who could afford it.[44] Greek-style medallion portrait sculptures on a stela, or small mausoleum for the rich, housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a roadside, where it would be very visible to the living and perpetuate the memory of the dead.  Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial (see married couple funerary reliefs).[45]\nIn later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style.  Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the Tomb of the Scipios, were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms.  The Castel Sant'Angelo, built for Hadrian, was later converted into a fortress.  Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen.[46] Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards,[47] although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the atrium.  They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by Pliny the Elder and Polybius.  Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield (clipeus), and having it hung in a temple or other public place.  No examples of either type have survived.[48]\nBy the late Republic there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the deceased and increase the prestige of their family.  Examples include the Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker, a freedman, the Pyramid of Cestius, and the Mausoleum of Caecilia Metella, all built within a few decades of the start of the Common Era.[49]\nIn Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd-century Portonaccio sarcophagus, and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an \"architectural background of columns and niches for its figures\".[50] A well-known Early Christian example is the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus, used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire.[51] The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from Greek mythology, treated allegorically;[52] they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using biblical scenes.[53]\n\nChina[edit]\n\"Chinese tomb\" redirects here. See also Han dynasty tomb architecture.\nTang dynasty tomb figure, sancai glazes, of a Bactrian camel and its foreign driver\nFunerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods, and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by tomb robbers.  For a long time, literary references to jade burial suits were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths, but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century, and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers.  Knowledge of pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at Sanxingdui and other sites.  Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, mausoleums.  Several special large shapes of Shang dynasty bronze ritual vessels were probably made for burial only; large numbers were buried in elite tombs, while other sets remained above ground for the family to use in making offerings in ancestor veneration rituals.  The Tomb of Fu Hao (c. BCE 1200) is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated—most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.[54]\nThe discovery in 1974 of the Terracotta Army located the tomb of the First Qin Emperor (died 210 BCE), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions survive, has not been excavated.  Remains surviving above ground from several imperial tombs of the Han dynasty show traditions maintained until the end of imperial rule.  The tomb itself is an \"underground palace\" beneath a sealed tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accommodation of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as gateways, towers and other buildings.\n\n\"Military Guardian\", Chinese funerary statue. Seattle Art Museum, Seattle, Washington.\nTang dynasty tomb figures, in \"three-colour\" sancai glazes or overglaze paint, show a wide range of servants, entertainers, animals and fierce tomb guardians between about 12 and 120 cm high, and were arranged around the tomb, often in niches along the sloping access path to the underground chamber.\nChinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a \"spirit road\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \"lions\" and \"chimeras\"; in later periods they are much more varied.[55] A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.[56]\nThe Goguryeo tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings.  Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.[57]\nThe Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.[58] The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period.  A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing.[59] After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \"funerary couches\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious.[60] During the Han dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the Six Dynasties, sculptural miniatures depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the hunping funerary vessels.[61] The outsides of tombs often featured monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que 闕); an example from 121 CE appears to be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above ground.[62] Tombs of the Tang dynasty (618–907) are often rich in glazed pottery figurines of horses, servants and other subjects, whose forceful and free style is greatly admired today. The tomb art reached its peak in the Song and Jin periods; most spectacular tombs were built by rich commoners.[63]\nEarly burial customs show a strong belief in an afterlife and a spirit path to it that needed facilitating.  Funerals and memorials were also an opportunity to reaffirm such important cultural values as filial piety and \"the honor and respect due to seniors, the duties incumbent on juniors\"[64] The common Chinese funerary symbol of a woman in the door may represent a \"basic male fantasy of an elysian afterlife with no restrictions: in all the doorways of the houses stand available women looking for newcomers to welcome into their chambers\"[65] Han dynasty inscriptions often describe the filial mourning for their subjects.[66]\n\nKorea[edit]\nHunting scene from the North wall of the main chamber of the Muyongchong Tomb (Tomb of the Dancers), (5th century CE), Ji'an.\nMurals painted on the walls of the Goguryeo tombs are examples of Korean painting from its Three Kingdoms era. Although thousands of these tombs have been found, only about 100 have murals.[67] These tombs are often named for the dominating theme of the murals—these include the Tomb of the Dancers, the Tomb of the Hunters, the Tomb of the Four Spirits, and the Tomb of the Wrestlers.[68] Heavenly bodies are a common motif, as are depictions of events from the lives of the royalty and nobles whose bodies had been entombed. The former include the sun, represented as a three-legged bird inside a wheel,[69] and the various constellations, including especially the Four directional constellations: the Azure Dragon of the East, the Vermilion Bird of the South, the White Tiger of the West, and the Black Tortoise of the North.[70]\nThe Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty in Korea, built between 1408 and 1966, reflect a combination of Chinese and Japanese traditions, with a tomb mound, often surrounded by a screen wall of stone blocks, and sometimes with stone animal figures above ground, not unlike the Japanese haniwa figures (see below).  There is usually one or more T-shaped shrine buildings some distance in front of the tomb, which is set in extensive grounds, usually with a hill behind them, and facing a view towards water and distant hills.  They are still a focus for ancestor worship rituals.  From the 15th century, they became more simple, while retaining a large landscape setting.[71]\n\nJapan[edit]\n6th-century Japanese haniwa clay figure; these were buried with the dead in the Kofun period (3rd to 6th centuries CE)\nThe Kofun period of Japanese history, from the 3rd to 6th centuries CE, is named after kofun, the often enormous keyhole-shaped Imperial mound-tombs, often on a moated island.  None of these have ever been allowed to be excavated, so their possibly spectacular contents remain unknown.[72] Late examples which have been investigated, such as the Kitora Tomb, had been robbed of most of their contents, but the Takamatsuzuka Tomb retains mural paintings.  Lower down the social scale in the same period, terracotta haniwa figures, as much as a metre high, were deposited on top of aristocratic tombs as grave markers, with others left inside, apparently representing possessions such as horses and houses for use in the afterlife.[73] Both kofun mounds and haniwa figures appear to have been discontinued as Buddhism became the dominant Japanese religion.[74]\nSince then, Japanese tombs have been typically marked by elegant but simple rectangular vertical gravestones with inscriptions.  Funerals are one of the areas in Japanese life where Buddhist customs are followed even by those who followed other traditions, such as Shinto.  The bodaiji is a special and very common type of temple whose main purpose is as a venue for rites of ancestor worship, though it is often not the actual burial site.  This was originally a custom of the feudal lords, but was adopted by other classes from about the 16th century. Each family would use a particular bodaiji over generations, and it might contain a second \"grave\" if the actual burial were elsewhere.  Many later emperors, from the 13th to 19th centuries, are buried simply at the Imperial bodaiji, the Tsuki no wa no misasagi mausoleum in the Sennyū-ji temple at Kyoto.[75]\n\nThe Americas[edit]\nA \"shaft tomb\" tableau from Nayarit, Mexico, 300 BCE to CE 600[76]\nUnlike many Western cultures, that of Mesoamerica is generally lacking in sarcophagi, with a few notable exceptions such as that of Pacal the Great or the now-lost sarcophagus from the Olmec site of La Venta.  Instead, most Mesoamerican funerary art takes the form of grave goods and, in Oaxaca, funerary urns holding the ashes of the deceased. Two well-known examples of Mesoamerican grave goods are those from Jaina Island, a Maya site off the coast of Campeche, and those associated with the Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition.  The tombs of Mayan rulers can only normally be identified by inferences drawn from the lavishness of the grave goods and, with the possible exception of vessels made from stone rather than pottery, these appear to contain no objects specially made for the burial.[77]\n\nFunerary Mask, c. 300 BCE, painted ceramic\nThe Jaina Island graves are noted for their abundance of clay figurines.  Human remains within the roughly 1,000 excavated graves on the island (out of 20,000 total)[78] were found to be accompanied by glassware, slateware, or pottery, as well as one or more ceramic figurines, usually resting on the occupant's chest or held in their hands.  The function of these figurines is not known: due to gender and age mismatches, they are unlikely to be portraits of the grave occupants, although the later figurines are known to be representations of goddesses.[79]\nThe so-called shaft tomb tradition of western Mexico is known almost exclusively from grave goods, which include hollow ceramic figures, obsidian and shell jewelry, pottery, and other items (see this Flickr photo for a reconstruction).  Of particular note are the various ceramic tableaux including village scenes, for example, players engaged in a Mesoamerican ballgame.  Although these tableaux may merely depict village life, it has been proposed that they instead (or also) depict the underworld.[80] Ceramic dogs are also widely known from looted tombs, and are thought by some to represent psychopomps (soul guides),[81] although dogs were often the major source of protein in ancient Mesoamerica.[82]\n\nA funerary urn in the shape of a \"bat god\" or a jaguar, from Oaxaca, dated to CE 300–650.[83]\nThe Zapotec civilization of Oaxaca is particularly known for its clay funerary urns, such as the \"bat god\" shown at right.  Numerous types of urns have been identified.[84] While some show deities and other supernatural beings, others seem to be portraits.  Art historian George Kubler is particularly enthusiastic about the craftsmanship of this tradition:\n\nNo other American potters ever explored so completely the plastic conditions of wet clay or retained its forms so completely after firing ... [they] used its wet and ductile nature for fundamental geometric modelling and cut the material, when half-dry, into smooth planes with sharp edges of an unmatched brilliance and suggestiveness of form.[85]\nThe Maya Naj Tunich cave tombs and other sites contain paintings, carved stelae, and grave goods in pottery, jade and metal, including death masks. In dry areas, many ancient textiles have been found in graves from South America's Paracas culture, which wrapped its mummies tightly in several layers of elaborately patterned cloth.  Elite Moche graves, containing especially fine pottery, were incorporated into large adobe structures also used for human sacrifices, such as the Huaca de la Luna.  Andean cultures such as the Sican often practiced mummification and left grave goods in precious metals with jewels, including tumi ritual knives and gold funerary masks, as well as pottery. The Mimbres of the Mogollon culture buried their dead with bowls on top of their heads and ceremonially \"killed\" each bowl with a small hole in the centre so that the deceased's spirit could rise to another world. Mimbres funerary bowls show scenes of hunting, gambling, planting crops, fishing, sexual acts and births.[86] Some of the North American mounds, such as Grave Creek Mound (c. 250–150 BCE) in West Virginia, functioned as burial sites, while others had different purposes.[87]\n\nDeath's head, Boston MA\nThe earliest colonist graves were either unmarked, or had very simple timber headstone, with little order to their plotting, reflecting their Puritan origins. However, a tradition of visual funerary art began to develop c. 1640, providing insights into their views of death. The lack of artistry of the earliest known headstones reflects the puritan's stern religious doctrine. Late seventeenth century examples often show a death's head; a stylized skull sometimes with wings or crossed bones, and other realistic imagery depicting humans decay into skulls, bones and dust. The style softened during the late 18th century as Unitarianism and Methodism became more popular.[88] Mid 18th century examples often show the deceased carried by the wings that would apparently take its soul to heaven.[89]\n\nTraditional societies[edit]\nA stone-carved Toraja cliff burial site. Tau tau (effigies of the deceased) look out over the land.\nThere is an enormous diversity of funeral art from traditional societies across the world, much of it in perishable materials, and some is mentioned elsewhere in the article.  In traditional African societies, masks often have a specific association with death, and some types may be worn mainly or exclusively for funeral ceremonies.[90] Akan peoples of West Africa commissioned nsodie memorial heads of royal personages. The funeral ceremonies of the Indigenous Australians typically feature body painting; the Yolngu and Tiwi people create carved pukumani burial poles from ironwood trunks,[91] while elaborately carved burial trees have been used in south-eastern Australia.[92] The Toraja people of central Sulawesi are famous for their burial practices, which include the setting-up of effigies of the dead on cliffs.  The 19th- and 20th-century royal Kasubi Tombs in Uganda, destroyed by fire in 2010, were a circular compound of thatched buildings similar to those inhabited by the earlier Kabakas when alive, but with special characteristics.[93]\nIn several cultures, goods for use in the afterlife are still interred or cremated, for example Hell bank notes in East Asian communities.[94] In Ghana, mostly among the Ga people, elaborate figurative coffins in the shape of cars, boats or animals are made of wood. These were introduced in the 1950s by Seth Kane Kwei.[95]\n\nFunerary art and religion[edit]\nHinduism[edit]\nCremation is traditional among Hindus, who also believe in reincarnation, and there is far less of a tradition of funerary monuments in Hinduism than in other major religions.[96] However, there are regional, and relatively recent, traditions among royalty, and the samādhi mandir is a memorial temple for a saint.  Both may be influenced by Islamic practices.  The mausoleums of the kings of Orchha, from the 16th century onwards, are among the best known. Other rulers were commemorated by memorial temples of the normal type for the time and place, which like similar buildings from other cultures fall outside the scope of this article, though Angkor Wat in Cambodia, the most spectacular of all, must be mentioned.\n\nBuddhism[edit]\nBuddhist tombs themselves are typically simple and modest, although they may be set within temples, sometimes large complexes, built for the purpose in the then-prevailing style.  According to tradition, the remains of the Buddha's body after cremation were entirely divided up into relics (cetiya), which played an important part in early Buddhism.  The stupa developed as a monument enclosing deposits of relics of the Buddha from plain hemispherical mounds in the 3rd century BCE to elaborate structures such as those at Sanchi in India and Borobudur in Java.  Regional variants such as the pagoda of China and Japan and the candi of Indonesia evolved from the Indian form.  However, none of these can strictly be called tombs.[97] Some important Tibetan lamas are buried in relatively small chortens (Tibetan stupas), sometimes of precious metal, inside or outside monasteries, sometimes after mummification. There are examples at Kursha Monastery in Zanskar and Tashiding Monastery in Sikkim, as well as the Potala Palace in Lhasa and many other monasteries.[98] However, most chortens do not function as tombs.\n\nChristianity[edit]\nSee also: tomb effigy and monumental brass\nPlaster cast of the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus\nThe Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs.  Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes.[99] The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church.[100] The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture).[101] An exception in the Classical World were the Lycians of Anatolia. There are also the Egyptian mortuary-temples, where the object of worship was the deified royal person entombed, but Egyptian temples to the major gods contained no burials. An extreme example was ancient Delos.\n\nMedieval and Renaissance wall tombs in Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, including an equestrian statue at the left\nChristians believed in a bodily resurrection of the dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963.[102] Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial has always been the preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete,[103] while the tomb of St Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.[104]\nIf only because its strong prejudice against free-standing and life-size sculpture, Eastern Orthodoxy could not have developed the tomb monument in the same way as the Western Church, and the burials of rich or important individuals continued the classical tradition of sarcophagi carved in relief, with the richness of the carving tending to diminish over the centuries, until just simple religious symbols were left.  Constantine I and most later Byzantine Emperors up to 1028 were buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, which was destroyed after the fall of Constantinople of 1453.  Some massive but mostly plain porphyry sarcophagi from the church are now placed outside the Istanbul Archaeology Museums.[105]\nThe Tomb of Antipope John XXIII in Florence is a grand Early Renaissance wall tomb by Donatello and Michelozzo; although classical in style, it reflects the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs.  It has a life-size effigy, also known as a gisant, lying on the sarcophagus, which was common from the Romanesque period through to the Baroque and beyond.[106] Ruling dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the Chartreuse de Champmol was founded for that purpose by the Valois Dukes of Burgundy in 1383.  The Scaliger tombs in Verona are magnificent free-standing Gothic canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height.[107] Important churches like St Peter's in Rome, St Paul's Cathedral, London, Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice (twenty-five Doges), and the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available.  Local parish churches are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables.  Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, bequests would pay for masses to be said in perpetuity for their souls.  By the High Renaissance, led by Michelangelo's tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand.  Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.[108]\n\n\"The Mirror of Death\": Detail from a French Renaissance monument of 1547\nIn the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \"Art of Dying\".[109] It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy.[110] As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.\nThe church struggled to eliminate the pagan habits of leaving grave goods except for the clothing and usual jewellery of the powerful, especially rings.  Kings might be buried with a sceptre, and bishops with a crozier, their respective symbols of office.[111] The 7th-century Stonyhurst Gospel, with a unique Insular original leather binding, was recovered from St Cuthbert's coffin, itself a significant object.[112] The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, as those of the Black Prince still are in Canterbury Cathedral. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white winding-sheet, as being all that would be required at the Second Coming.  For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living.  The use of a rich cloth pall to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black.  They were usually then given to the Church to use for vestments or other decorations.[113]\nFrom the early 13th century to the 16th, a popular form of monument north of the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the monumental brass, a sheet of brass on which the image of the person or persons commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural surround.  They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women.  Many bishops and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.[114]\n\nLigier Richier, Cadaver Tomb of René of Chalon, c. 1545–47\nCastrum doloris for Queen Katarzyna Opalińska of Poland, erected in Notre Dame de Paris in 1747\nThe castrum doloris was a temporary catafalque erected around the coffin for the lying in state of important people, usually in a church, the funerary version of the elaborate temporary decorations for other court festivities, like royal entries.  These began in the late Middle Ages, but reached their height of elaboration in the 18th century.[115] A particular feature in Poland was the coffin portrait, a bust-length painted portrait of the deceased, attached to the coffin, but removed before burial and often then hung in the church.  Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion. Hatchments were a special lozenge-shaped painted coat of arms which was displayed on the house of the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the church.  Like mourning clothes, these fall outside a strict definition of art.[116]\nFor some time after the Protestant Reformation, English church monuments formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, especially in sculpture.  The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in Lutheran countries, but Calvinists tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture.[117] Many portraits were painted after death, and sometimes dead family members were included along with the living; a variety of indications might be used to suggest the distinction.[118]\nThe large Baroque tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the deceased, and was more likely to include personified figures of Death, Time, Virtues or other figures than angels.  The late medieval transi tomb vocabulary of images of bodily decay, such as skulls and skeletons, was sometimes re-introduced, but in a less confrontational manner.[119] Neo-Classicism, led by Antonio Canova, revived the classical stela, either with a portrait or a personification; in this style there was little or no difference between the demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons.[120]\nBy the 19th century, many Old World churchyards and church walls had completely run out of room for new monuments, and cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, towns or villages became the usual place for burials.[121] The rich developed the classical styles of the ancient world for small family tombs, while the rest continued to use gravestones or what were now usually false sarcophagi, placed over a buried coffin.  The cemeteries of the large Italian cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms of extravagant statuary, especially the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno in Genoa, the Cimitero Monumentale di Milano and the Certosa di Bologna.[122] In Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in maquette form.[123]\n\n19th-century bourgeois family tombs at Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris\nMonuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during the 19th century, embracing Symbolism enthusiastically, but then gradually became detached from the avant-garde after Art Nouveau and a few Art Deco examples.[124] Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial stained glass windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a commemorative panel, are often found.  War memorials, other than on the site of a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became increasingly common during it, and after World War I were erected even in villages of the main combatant nations.[125]\n\nIslam[edit]\nIslamic funerary art is dominated by architecture.  Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials.[126] Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription.  However, funerary architecture often offered a means of \"moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites\" and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity.[127]\nA number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements.  The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the hadith \"condemn the building of tombs, and Muhammad himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house\" in Medina,[128] though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast Al-Masjid an-Nabawi complex already marked the site.  The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in Samarra in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there.[129] At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of Paradise, an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace.  At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose.  Versions of the formal Persian charbagh design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.[130]\n\nBrick Samanid Mausoleum, c. 910, BokharaHumayun's Tomb (1560s), Delhi, in its garden settingTurkish gravestones, capped by a turban, in Istanbul\nAnother influence may have been the octagonal Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, not a mausoleum itself, but \"the earliest Islamic model for centrally planned commemorative buildings\", adapting the Byzantine form of the martyrium in a building standing alone, though on a stone platform rather than in a garden.[131] In the Persian sphere, a tradition of relatively small mausoleums evolved, often in the shape of short hexagonal or octagonal domed towers, usually containing a single chamber, like the Malek Tomb.  These single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the Timurid and Mughal Empires,[132] like the Gur-e Amir tomb of Timur at Samarkand and the famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the Taj Mahal. The Mughal tombs are mostly set in a large walled charbagh (chahar-bagh) or Mughal gardens, often with pavilions at the corners[132] and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river Yamuna; a central placing is usual.[133] They may have minarets, although they do not normally function as mosques.  The Tomb of Jahangir lacks any dome,[134] while the Tomb of Akbar the Great has only small decorative ones.  Other Islamic Indian rulers built similar tombs, such as Gol Gumbaz.\nIn all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard.  Decoration was often tilework, and could include parchin kari inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving.  No animals would be represented, but geometric patterns and written inscriptions were common.  The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room.  Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the Qur'an in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The Mausoleum of Khomeini, still under construction in a Tehran cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.[135]\nThe tradition evolved differently in the Ottoman world, where smaller single-roomed türbe typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often built by the deceased.  The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone turban, which is also traditional at the top of ordinary Turkish gravestones (usually in stylised form). Two of the most famous are in the Süleymaniye Mosque in Istanbul; the Yeşil Türbe (\"Green Tomb\") of 1421 is an unusually large example in Bursa, and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly colored tiles.[136]\nOther parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions.  The 15th-century royal Tomb of Askia in Mali used the local technique of mud-building to erect a 17-metre-high (56 ft) pyramidal tomb set in a mosque complex.[137] At the other end of the Islamic world, Javanese royalty are mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at Kota GedMe and Imogiri. Mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, madrasah or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common.  The tomb-mosque of Sultan Qaitbay (died 1496) is a famous example, one of many in Cairo, though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the whole.[138]\n\nContemporary period[edit]\nThe Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial to the 65,000 Austrian Jews killed in the Holocaust, designed by Rachel Whiteread and completed in 2000\nFunerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect modernism or other recent styles.  Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially war memorials, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and several Holocaust memorials, such as Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, the Vel d'Hiv Memorial in Paris (1994), the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin (2004), and the Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate.[139] Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated Neue Wache in Berlin[140] and the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo, which is internationally controversial.[141]\nSeveral critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to genocide, at least on the Western side of the Iron Curtain.[142] In the Communist East the established style of Socialist Realism was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities.[143] The generation of abstracted and conceptual war and Holocaust memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.[144]\nMany large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including Lenin's Mausoleum and those for Atatürk, Jinnah, Kim Il-Sung, Che Guevara and several presidential memorials in the United States, although the actual burials of recent presidents are very simple, with their presidential library and museum now usually their largest commemorative memorial.  The Mausoleum of Khomeini is a grand mosque complex, as large as any medieval example, not least because it includes a 20,000 place parking lot.[135]\n\nSee also[edit]\nList of types of funerary monument\nList of mausolea\nMourning portraits\nGiannino Castiglioni\nBrion tomb\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ See for example the chapter \"Tombs for the Living and the Dead\", Insoll 176–87.\n\n^ Hammond, 58–59 characterizes disarticulated human skeletal remains packed in body bags and incorporated into Pre-Classic Mesoamerican mass burials (along with a set of primary remains) at Cuello, Belize as \"human grave goods\".\n\n^ See any well-regarded survey of the history of art or of architecture, such as Gardner's Art Through the Ages or the most recent edition of Sir Banister Fletcher's A History of Architecture.\n\n^ \"funerary\".

Microsoft Academic was shut down in 2022. Both OpenAlex[1][2] and The Lens claim to be successors to Microsoft Academic.[3]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nMicrosoft Academic gained prominence because it profiled authors, organizations, keywords, and journals[4] and made the dataset available as open data, in contrast to Google Scholar. The search engine indexed over 260 million publications,[5] 88 million of which are journal articles.[5]\nPreliminary reviews by bibliometricians suggested the new Microsoft Academic Search was a competitor to Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus for academic research purposes[6][7] as well as citation analysis.[8][9][10] However, it was primarily used as a resource in the field of computer science since that was the most completely indexed information.[11]\nOn May 4, 2021, Microsoft announced that the Microsoft Academic website and APIs would be retired on December 31, 2021.[12]\nThanks to the open data license, the Microsoft Academic dataset was merged into OpenAlex. However, the underlying software was proprietary and had to be rewritten.\nThat Microsoft launched and soon after shut down both Microsoft Academic and its predecessor Microsoft Academic Search has been interpreted as a sign that Microsoft \"had never intended to enter into the business of scholarly metadata. Instead, the tech giant has been using data on scholarly communication as testing ground for big data and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies\".[13]\n\nTechnology[edit]\nThe Academic Knowledge API offered information retrieval from the underlying database using REST endpoints for advanced research purposes.[14] The search engine provided not only search results and access to sources but also citation information that include the number of sources, g-index, and h-index.[15] Aside from academic publications, it was also used to find websites that contain state and local records.[16] The technology uses machine learning, semantic inference and knowledge discovery from sources crawled and indexed by the Bing search engine.[17]\nMicrosoft Academic replaced the earlier Microsoft research project, Microsoft Academic Search, which ended development in 2012.[18] The platform was developed in 2009 of the Microsoft Research branch in Asia and the project was headed by Zaiqing Nie.[4] Microsoft Academic was re-launched in 2016, as a tool that features an entirely new data structure and search engine using semantic search technologies.\n\nSee also[edit]\nOpenAlex\nMicrosoft Academic Search\nLive Search Academic\nList of academic databases and search engines\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Priem, Jason; Piwowar, Heather; Orr, Richard (2022). \"OpenAlex: A fully-open index of scholarly works, authors, venues, institutions, and concepts\". arXiv:2205.01833 [cs.DL].\n\n^ Singh Chawla, Dalmeet (24 January 2022). \"Massive open index of scholarly papers launches\".

        "title": "Transport Layer Security",
        "content": "Cryptographic protocols for securing data in transit\nTransport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol designed to provide communications security over a computer network, such as the Internet. The protocol is widely used in applications such as email, instant messaging, and voice over IP, but its use in securing HTTPS remains the most publicly visible.\nThe TLS protocol aims primarily to provide security, including privacy (confidentiality), integrity, and authenticity through the use of cryptography, such as the use of certificates, between two or more communicating computer applications. It runs in the presentation layer and is itself composed of two layers: the TLS record and the TLS handshake protocols.\nThe closely related Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) is a communications protocol that provides security to datagram-based applications. In technical writing, references to \"(D)TLS\" are often seen when it applies to both versions.[1]\nTLS is a proposed Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard, first defined in 1999, and the current version is TLS 1.3, defined in August 2018. TLS builds on the now-deprecated SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) specifications (1994, 1995, 1996) developed by Netscape Communications for adding the HTTPS protocol to their Netscape Navigator web browser.\n\n\nDescription[edit]\nClient–server applications use the TLS protocol to communicate across a network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.\nSince applications can communicate either with or without TLS (or SSL), it is necessary for the client to request that the server set up a TLS connection.[2] One of the main ways of achieving this is to use a different port number for TLS connections. Port 80 is typically used for unencrypted HTTP traffic while port 443 is the common port used for encrypted HTTPS traffic. Another mechanism is to make a protocol-specific STARTTLS request to the server to switch the connection to TLS – for example, when using some mail and news protocols.\nOnce the client and server have agreed to use TLS, they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure (see § TLS handshake).[3] The protocols use a handshake with an asymmetric cipher to establish not only cipher settings but also a session-specific shared key with which further communication is encrypted using a symmetric cipher. During this handshake, the client and server agree on various parameters used to establish the connection's security:\n\nThe handshake begins when a client connects to a TLS-enabled server requesting a secure connection and the client presents a list of supported cipher suites (ciphers and hash functions).\nFrom this list, the server picks a cipher and hash function that it also supports and notifies the client of the decision.\nThe server usually then provides identification in the form of a digital certificate. The certificate contains the server name, the trusted certificate authority (CA) that vouches for the authenticity of the certificate, and the server's public encryption key.\nThe client confirms the validity of the certificate before proceeding.\nTo generate the session keys used for the secure connection, the client either:\nencrypts a random number (PreMasterSecret) with the server's public key and sends the result to the server (which only the server should be able to decrypt with its private key); both parties then use the random number to generate a unique session key for subsequent encryption and decryption of data during the session, or\nuses Diffie–Hellman key exchange (or its variant elliptic-curve DH) to securely generate a random and unique session key for encryption and decryption that has the additional property of forward secrecy: if the server's private key is disclosed in the future, it cannot be used to decrypt the current session, even if the session is intercepted and recorded by a third party.\nThis concludes the handshake and begins the secured connection, which is encrypted and decrypted with the session key until the connection closes. If any one of the above steps fails, then the TLS handshake fails and the connection is not created.\nNote that TLS 1.3 only allows key exchange algorithms providing forward secrecy. Consequently, establishing a PreMasterSecret using the server's public and private key is only available in TLS 1.2 and below.\nTLS and SSL do not fit neatly into any single layer of the OSI model or the TCP/IP model.[4][5] TLS runs \"on top of some reliable transport protocol (e.g., TCP),\"[6]: §1  which would imply that it is above the transport layer. It serves encryption to higher layers, which is normally the function of the presentation layer. However, applications generally use TLS as if it were a transport layer,[4][5] even though applications using TLS must actively control initiating TLS handshakes and handling of exchanged authentication certificates.[6]: §1 \nWhen secured by TLS, connections between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., wikipedia.org) will have all of the following properties:[6]: §1 \n\nThe connection is private (or has confidentiality) because a symmetric-key algorithm is used to encrypt the data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based on a shared secret that was negotiated at the start of the session. The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data is transmitted (see below). The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure (the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the communications during the negotiation without being detected).\nThe identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using public-key cryptography. This authentication is required for the server and optional for the client.\nThe connection is reliable (or has integrity) because each message transmitted includes a message integrity check using a message authentication code to prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during transmission.\nTLS supports many different methods for exchanging keys, encrypting data, and authenticating message integrity. As a result, secure configuration of TLS involves many configurable parameters, and not all choices provide all of the privacy-related properties described in the list above (see the tables below § Key exchange, § Cipher security, and § Data integrity).\nAttempts have been made to subvert aspects of the communications security that TLS seeks to provide, and the protocol has been revised several times to address these security threats. Developers of web browsers have repeatedly revised their products to defend against potential security weaknesses after these were discovered (see TLS/SSL support history of web browsers).\n\nDatagram Transport Layer Security[edit]\nDatagram Transport Layer Security, abbreviated DTLS, is a related communications protocol providing security to datagram-based applications by allowing them to communicate in a way designed[7][8] to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, or message forgery. The DTLS protocol is based on the stream-oriented Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol and is intended to provide similar security guarantees. However, unlike TLS, it can be used with most datagram oriented protocols including User Datagram Protocol (UDP), Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP), Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) encapsulation, and Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP).\nAs the DTLS protocol datagram preserves the semantics of the underlying transport, the application does not suffer from the delays associated with stream protocols. However, the application has to deal with packet reordering, loss of datagram and data larger than the size of a datagram network packet. Because DTLS uses UDP or SCTP rather than TCP, it avoids the TCP meltdown problem,[9][10] when being used to create a VPN tunnel.\nThe original 2006 release of DTLS version 1.0 was not a standalone document. It was given as a series of deltas to TLS 1.1.[7]: §4  Similarly the follow-up 2012 release of DTLS is a delta to TLS 1.2. It was given the version number of DTLS 1.2 to match its TLS version. Lastly, the 2022 DTLS 1.3 is a delta to TLS 1.3. Like the two previous versions, DTLS 1.3 is intended to provide \"equivalent security guarantees [to TLS 1.3] with the exception of order protection/non-replayability\".[11]\nMany VPN clients including Cisco AnyConnect[12] & InterCloud Fabric,[13] OpenConnect,[14] ZScaler tunnel,[15] F5 Networks Edge VPN Client,[16] and Citrix Systems NetScaler[17] use DTLS to secure UDP traffic. In addition all modern web browsers support DTLS-SRTP[18] for WebRTC.\n\nHistory and development[edit]\n\nSSL and TLS protocols\n\n\nProtocol\n\nPublished\n\nStatus\n\n\nUnsupported: SSL 1.0\n\nUnpublished\n\nUnpublished\n\n\nUnsupported: SSL 2.0\n\n1995\n\nDeprecated in 2011[19]\n\n\nUnsupported: SSL 3.0\n\n1996\n\nDeprecated in 2015[20]\n\n\nUnsupported: TLS 1.0\n\n1999\n\nDeprecated in 2021[21][22][23][24]\n\n\nUnsupported: TLS 1.1\n\n2006\n\nDeprecated in 2021[21][22][23][24]\n\n\nSupported: TLS 1.2\n\n2008\n\nIn use since 2008[25][26]\n\n\nLatest version: TLS 1.3\n\n2018\n\nIn use since 2018[26][27]\n\n\nLegend:UnsupportedSupportedLatest versionPreview versionFuture version\n\nEarly research projects[edit]\nSecure Data Network System[edit]\n\nIn August 1986, the National Security Agency, the National Bureau of Standards, the Defense Communications Agency launched a project, called the Secure Data Network System (SDNS), with the intent of designing the next generation of secure computer communications network and product specifications to be implemented for applications on public and private internets. It was intended to complement the rapidly emerging new OSI internet standards moving forward both in the U.S. government's GOSIP Profiles and in the huge ITU-ISO JTC1 internet effort internationally.[28]\nAs part of the project, researchers designed a protocol called SP4 (security protocol in layer 4 of the OSI system). This was later renamed the Transport Layer Security Protocol (TLSP) and subsequently published in 1995 as international standard ITU-T X.274|ISO/IEC 10736:1995.[29] Despite the name similarity, this is distinct from today's TLS.\n\nSecure Network Programming (SNP)[edit]\nOther efforts towards transport layer security included the Secure Network Programming (SNP) application programming interface (API), which in 1993 explored the approach of having a secure transport layer API closely resembling Berkeley sockets, to facilitate retrofitting pre-existing network applications with security measures. SNP was published and presented in the 1994 USENIX Summer Technical Conference.[30][31] The SNP project was funded by a grant from NSA to Professor Simon Lam at UT-Austin in 1991.[32] Secure Network Programming won the 2004 ACM Software System Award.[33][34]  Simon Lam was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame for \"inventing secure sockets in 1991 and implementing the first secure sockets layer, named SNP, in 1993.\"[35][36]\n\nSSL 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0[edit]\n\"SSL 1\" redirects here. For the enzyme, see Presqualene diphosphate synthase.\nNetscape developed the original SSL protocols, and Taher Elgamal, chief scientist at Netscape Communications from 1995 to 1998, has been described as the \"father of SSL\".[37][38][39][40] SSL version 1.0 was never publicly released because of serious security flaws in the protocol. Version 2.0, after being released in February 1995 was quickly found to contain a number of security and usability flaws. It used the same cryptographic keys for message authentication and encryption. It had a weak MAC construction that used the MD5 hash function with a secret prefix, making it vulnerable to length extension attacks. It also provided no protection for either the opening handshake or an explicit message close, both of which meant man-in-the-middle attacks could go undetected. Moreover, SSL 2.0 assumed a single service and a fixed domain certificate, conflicting with the widely used feature of virtual hosting in Web servers, so most websites were effectively impaired from using SSL.\nThese flaws necessitated the complete redesign of the protocol to SSL version 3.0.[41][39] Released in 1996, it was produced by Paul Kocher working with Netscape engineers Phil Karlton and Alan Freier, with a reference implementation by Christopher Allen and Tim Dierks of Certicom. Newer versions of SSL/TLS are based on SSL 3.0. The 1996 draft of SSL 3.0 was published by IETF as a historical document in RFC 6101.\nSSL 2.0 was deprecated in 2011 by RFC 6176. In 2014, SSL 3.0 was found to be vulnerable to the POODLE attack that affects all block ciphers in SSL; RC4, the only non-block cipher supported by SSL 3.0, is also feasibly broken as used in SSL 3.0.[42] SSL 3.0 was deprecated in June 2015 by RFC 7568.\n\nTLS 1.0[edit]\nTLS 1.0 was first defined in RFC 2246 in January 1999 as an upgrade of SSL Version 3.0, and written by Christopher Allen and Tim Dierks of Certicom. As stated in the RFC, \"the differences between this protocol and SSL 3.0 are not dramatic, but they are significant enough to preclude interoperability between TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0\". Tim Dierks later wrote that these changes, and the renaming from \"SSL\" to \"TLS\", were a face-saving gesture to Microsoft, \"so it wouldn't look [like] the IETF was just rubberstamping Netscape's protocol\".[43]\nThe PCI Council suggested that organizations migrate from TLS 1.0 to TLS 1.1 or higher before June 30, 2018.[44][45] In October 2018, Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla jointly announced they would deprecate TLS 1.0 and 1.1 in March 2020.[22] TLS 1.0 and 1.1 were formally deprecated in RFC 8996 in March 2021.\n\nTLS 1.1[edit]\nTLS 1.1 was defined in RFC 4346 in April 2006.[46] It is an update from TLS version 1.0. Significant differences in this version include:\n\nAdded protection against cipher-block chaining (CBC) attacks.\nThe implicit initialization vector (IV) was replaced with an explicit IV.\nChange in handling of padding errors.\nSupport for IANA registration of parameters.[47]\nSupport for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1 was widely deprecated by web sites around 2020,[48] disabling access to Firefox versions before 24 and Chromium-based browsers before 29,[49] though third-party fixes can be applied to Netscape Navigator and older versions of Firefox to add TLS 1.2 support.[50]\n\nTLS 1.2[edit]\nTLS 1.2 was defined in RFC 5246 in August 2008.[25] It is based on the earlier TLS 1.1 specification. Major differences include:\n\nThe MD5 and SHA-1 combination in the pseudorandom function (PRF) was replaced with SHA-256, with an option to use cipher suite specified PRFs.\nThe MD5 and SHA-1 combination in the finished message hash was replaced with SHA-256, with an option to use cipher suite specific hash algorithms. However, the size of the hash in the finished message must still be at least 96 bits.[25]: §7.4.9 \nThe MD5 and SHA-1 combination in the digitally signed element was replaced with a single hash negotiated during handshake, which defaults to SHA-1.\nEnhancement in the client's and server's ability to specify which hashes and signature algorithms they accept.\nExpansion of support for authenticated encryption ciphers, used mainly for Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) and CCM mode of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption.\nTLS Extensions definition and AES cipher suites were added.[47]\nAll TLS versions were further refined in RFC 6176 in March 2011, removing their backward compatibility with SSL such that TLS sessions never negotiate the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) version 2.0. As of April 2025 there is no formal date for TLS 1.2 to be deprecated. The specifications for TLS 1.2 became redefined as well by the Standards Track Document RFC 8446 to keep it as secure as possible; it is to be seen as a failover protocol now, meant only to be negotiated with clients which are unable to talk over TLS 1.3 (The original RFC 5246 definition for TLS 1.2 is since then obsolete).\n\nTLS 1.3[edit]\nTLS 1.3 was defined in RFC 8446 in August 2018.[6] It is based on the earlier TLS 1.2 specification. Major differences from TLS 1.2 include:[51]\n\nSeparating key agreement and authentication algorithms from the cipher suites[47][6]: §11 \nRemoving support for weak and less-used named elliptic curves\nRemoving support for MD5 and SHA-224 cryptographic hash functions\nRequiring digital signatures even when a previous configuration is used\nIntegrating HKDF and the semi-ephemeral DH proposal\nReplacing resumption with PSK and tickets\nSupporting 1-RTT handshakes and initial support for 0-RTT\nMandating perfect forward secrecy, by means of using ephemeral keys during the (EC)DH key agreement\nDropping support for many insecure or obsolete features including compression, renegotiation, non-AEAD ciphers, null ciphers,[52] non-PFS key exchange (among which are static RSA and static DH key exchanges), custom DHE groups, EC point format negotiation, Change Cipher Spec protocol, Hello message UNIX time, and the length field AD input to AEAD ciphers\nProhibiting SSL or RC4 negotiation for backwards compatibility\nIntegrating use of session hash\nDeprecating use of the record layer version number and freezing the number for improved backwards compatibility\nMoving some security-related algorithm details from an appendix to the specification and relegating ClientKeyShare to an appendix\nAdding the ChaCha20 stream cipher with the Poly1305 message authentication code\nAdding the Ed25519 and Ed448 digital signature algorithms\nAdding the x25519 and x448 key exchange protocols\nAdding support for sending multiple OCSP responses\nEncrypting all handshake messages after the ServerHello, including server certificate\nNetwork Security Services (NSS), the cryptography library developed by Mozilla and used by its web browser Firefox, enabled TLS 1.3 by default in February 2017.[53] TLS 1.3 support was subsequently added — but due to compatibility issues for a small number of users, not automatically enabled[54] — to Firefox 52.0, which was released in March 2017. TLS 1.3 was enabled by default in May 2018 with the release of Firefox 60.0.[55]\nGoogle Chrome set TLS 1.3 as the default version for a short time in 2017. It then removed it as the default, due to incompatible middleboxes such as Blue Coat web proxies.[56]\nThe intolerance of the new version of TLS was protocol ossification; middleboxes had ossified the protocol's version parameter. As a result, version 1.3 mimics the wire image of version 1.2. This change occurred very late in the design process, only having been discovered during browser deployment.[57] The discovery of this intolerance also led to the prior version negotiation strategy, where the highest matching version was picked, being abandoned due to unworkable levels of ossification.[58] 'Greasing' an extension point, where one protocol participant claims support for non-existent extensions to ensure that unrecognised-but-actually-existent extensions are tolerated and so to resist ossification, was originally designed for TLS, but it has since been adopted elsewhere.[58]\nDuring the IETF 100 Hackathon, which took place in Singapore in 2017, the TLS Group worked on adapting open-source applications to use TLS 1.3.[59][60] The TLS group was made up of individuals from Japan, United Kingdom, and Mauritius via the cyberstorm.mu team.[60] This work was continued in the IETF 101 Hackathon in London,[61] and the IETF 102 Hackathon in Montreal.[62]\nwolfSSL enabled the use of TLS 1.3 as of version 3.11.1, released in May 2017.[63] As the first commercial TLS 1.3 implementation, wolfSSL 3.11.1 supported Draft 18 and now supports Draft 28,[64] the final version, as well as many older versions. A series of blogs were published on the performance difference between TLS 1.2 and 1.3.[65]\nIn September 2018, the popular OpenSSL project released version 1.1.1 of its library, in which support for TLS 1.3 was \"the headline new feature\".[66]\nSupport for TLS 1.3 was added to Secure Channel (schannel) for the GA releases of Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022.[67]\n\nEnterprise Transport Security[edit]\nThe Electronic Frontier Foundation praised TLS 1.3 and expressed concern about the variant protocol Enterprise Transport Security (ETS) that intentionally disables important security measures in TLS 1.3.[68] Originally called Enterprise TLS (eTLS), ETS is a published standard known as the 'ETSI TS103523-3', \"Middlebox Security Protocol, Part3: Enterprise Transport Security\". It is intended for use entirely within proprietary networks such as banking systems. ETS does not support forward secrecy so as to allow third-party organizations connected to the proprietary networks to be able to use their private key to monitor network traffic for the detection of malware and to make it easier to conduct audits.[69][70] Despite the claimed benefits, the EFF warned that the loss of forward secrecy could make it easier for data to be exposed along with saying that there are better ways to analyze traffic.[68]\n\nDigital certificates[edit]\nMain article: Public key certificate\nExample of a website with digital certificate\nA digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the named subject of the certificate, and indicates certain expected usages of that key. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or on assertions made by the private key that corresponds to the certified public key. Keystores and trust stores can be in various formats, such as .pem, .crt, .pfx, and .jks.\n\nCertificate authorities[edit]\nMain article: Certificate authority\nTLS typically relies on a set of trusted third-party certificate authorities to establish the authenticity of certificates. Trust is usually anchored in a list of certificates distributed with user agent software,[71] and can be modified by the relying party.\nAccording to Netcraft, who monitors active TLS certificates, the market-leading certificate authority (CA) has been Symantec since the beginning of their survey (or VeriSign before the authentication services business unit was purchased by Symantec). As of 2015, Symantec accounted for just under a third of all certificates and 44% of the valid certificates used by the 1 million busiest websites, as counted by Netcraft.[72] In 2017, Symantec sold its TLS/SSL business to DigiCert.[73] In an updated report, it was shown that IdenTrust, DigiCert, and Sectigo are the top 3 certificate authorities in terms of market share since May 2019.[74]\nAs a consequence of choosing X.509 certificates, certificate authorities and a public key infrastructure are necessary to verify the relation between a certificate and its owner, as well as to generate, sign, and administer the validity of certificates. While this can be more convenient than verifying the identities via a web of trust, the 2013 mass surveillance disclosures made it more widely known that certificate authorities are a weak point from a security standpoint, allowing man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM) if the certificate authority cooperates (or is compromised).[75][76]\nOn April 11, 2025, the CA/Browser Forum approved a ballot that will require all public TLS certificate lifespans to gradually reduce to 47 days by 2029 [77]. The ballot was proposed by Apple.[78]\n\nAlgorithms[edit]\nSee also: Cipher suite\nKey exchange or key agreement[edit]\nBefore a client and server can begin to exchange information protected by TLS, they must securely exchange or agree upon an encryption key and a cipher to use when encrypting data (see § Cipher). Among the methods used for key exchange/agreement are: public and private keys generated with RSA (denoted TLS_RSA in the TLS handshake protocol), Diffie–Hellman (TLS_DH), ephemeral Diffie–Hellman (TLS_DHE), elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (TLS_ECDH), ephemeral elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (TLS_ECDHE), anonymous Diffie–Hellman (TLS_DH_anon),[25] pre-shared key (TLS_PSK)[79] and Secure Remote Password (TLS_SRP).[80]\nThe TLS_DH_anon and TLS_ECDH_anon key agreement methods do not authenticate the server or the user and hence are rarely used because those are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. Only TLS_DHE and TLS_ECDHE provide forward secrecy.\nPublic key certificates used during exchange/agreement also vary in the size of the public/private encryption keys used during the exchange and hence the robustness of the security provided. In July 2013, Google announced that it would no longer use 1024-bit public keys and would switch instead to 2048-bit keys to increase the security of the TLS encryption it provides to its users because the encryption strength is directly related to the key size.[81][82]\n\n\n\n\nKey exchange/agreement and authentication\n\n\nAlgorithm\n\nSSL 2.0\n\nSSL 3.0\n\nTLS 1.0\n\nTLS 1.1\n\nTLS 1.2\n\nTLS 1.3\n\nStatus\n\n\nRSA\n\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nDefined for TLS 1.2 in RFCs\n\n\nDH-RSA\n\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nDHE-RSA (forward secrecy)\n\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nECDH-RSA\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nECDHE-RSA (forward secrecy)\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nDH-DSS\n\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nDHE-DSS (forward secrecy)\n\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo[83]\n\n\nDHE-ECDSA (forward secrecy)\n\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nECDH-ECDSA\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nECDHE-ECDSA (forward secrecy)\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nDHE-EdDSA (forward secrecy)\n\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nECDH-EdDSA\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\n\nECDHE-EdDSA (forward secrecy)[84]\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\n\nPSK\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nRSA-PSK\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nDHE-PSK (forward secrecy)\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nECDHE-PSK (forward secrecy)\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nSRP\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nSRP-DSS\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nSRP-RSA\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nKerberos\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\n?\n\n\nDH-ANON (insecure)\n\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nECDH-ANON (insecure)\n\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nGOST R 34.10-2012[85]\n\nNo\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\nYes\n\nDefined for TLS 1.2[86] and for TLS 1.3.[87]\n\nCipher[edit]\nSee also: Cipher suite, Block cipher, and Cipher security summary\n\n\n\n\n\nCipher security against publicly known feasible attacks\n\n\nCipher\nProtocol version\nStatus\n\n\nType\n\nAlgorithm\n\nNominal strength (bits)\n\nSSL 2.0\n\nSSL 3.0[n 1][n 2][n 3][n 4]\n\nTLS 1.0[n 1][n 3]\n\nTLS 1.1[n 1]\n\nTLS 1.2[n 1]\n\nTLS 1.3\n\n\nBlock cipher with mode of operation\n\nAES GCM[88][89][n 5]\n\n256, 128\n\n—\n—\n—\n—\nSecure\nSecure\nDefined for TLS 1.2 in RFCs\n\n\nAES CCM[90][91][n 5]\n\n—\n—\n—\n—\nSecure\nSecure\n\n\nAES CBC[n 6]\n\n—\nInsecure\nDepends on mitigations\nDepends on mitigations\nDepends on mitigations\n—\n\n\nCamellia GCM[92][n 5]\n\n256, 128\n\n—\n—\n—\n—\nSecure\n—\n\n\nCamellia CBC[93][92][n 6]\n\n—\nInsecure\nDepends on mitigations\nDepends on mitigations\nDepends on mitigations\n—\n\n\nARIA GCM[94][n 5]\n\n256, 128\n\n—\n—\n—\n—\nSecure\n—\n\n\nARIA CBC[94][n 6]\n\n—\n—\nDepends on mitigations\nDepends on mitigations\nDepends on mitigations\n—\n\n\nSEED CBC[95][n 6]\n\n128\n\n—\nInsecure\nDepends on mitigations\nDepends on mitigations\nDepends on mitigations\n—\n\n\n3DES EDE CBC[n 6][n 7]\n\n112[n 8]\n\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\n\n\nGOST R 34.12-2015 Magma CTR[85][n 7]\n\n256\n\n—\n—\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\nDefined in RFC 4357, 9189\n\n\nGOST R 34.12-2015 Kuznyechik CTR[85]\n\n256\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nSecure\n\n—\n\nDefined in RFC 9189\n\n\nGOST R 34.12-2015 Magma MGM[85][n 5][n 7]\n\n256\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nInsecure\n\nDefined in RFC 9367\n\n\nGOST R 34.12-2015 Kuznyechik MGM[85][n 5]\n\n256\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\nSecure\n\nDefined in RFC 9367\n\n\nIDEA CBC[n 6][n 7][n 9]\n\n128\n\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\n—\nRemoved from TLS 1.2\n\n\nDES CBC[n 6][n 7][n 9]\n\n056\n\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\n—\n\n\n040[n 10]\n\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\n—\n—\nForbidden in TLS 1.1 and later\n\n\nRC2 CBC[n 6][n 7]\n\n040[n 10]\n\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\n—\n—\n\n\nStream cipher\n\nChaCha20-Poly1305[100][n 5]\n\n256\n\n—\n—\n—\n—\nSecure\nSecure\nDefined for TLS 1.2 in RFCs\n\n\nRC4[n 11]\n\n128\n\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\nProhibited in all versions of TLS[101]\n\n\n040[n 10]\n\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\n—\n—\n\n\nNone\n\nNull[n 12]\n\n–\n\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\nInsecure\n—\nDefined for TLS 1.2 in RFCs\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n^ a b c d RFC 5746 must be implemented to fix a renegotiation flaw that would otherwise break this protocol.\n\n^ If libraries implement fixes listed in RFC 5746, this violates the SSL 3.0 specification, which the IETF cannot change unlike TLS.

However, it has also been implemented with datagram-oriented transport protocols, such as the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) and the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP), usage of which has been standardized independently using the term Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS).\n\nWebsites[edit]\nA primary use of TLS is to secure World Wide Web traffic between a website and a web browser encoded with the HTTP protocol. This use of TLS to secure HTTP traffic constitutes the HTTPS protocol.[102]\n\n\nWebsite protocol support (September 2025)\n\n\nProtocolversion\n\nWebsitesupport[103]\n\nSecurity[103][104]\n\n\nUnsupported: SSL 2.0\n\n0.1%\n\nInsecure\n\n\nUnsupported: SSL 3.0\n\n1.0%\n\nInsecure[105]\n\n\nUnsupported: TLS 1.0\n\n23.5%\n\nDeprecated[22][23][24]\n\n\nUnsupported: TLS 1.1\n\n25.2%\n\nDeprecated[22][23][24]\n\n\nSupported: TLS 1.2\n\n100%\n\nDepends on cipher[n 1] and client mitigations[n 2]\n\n\nLatest version: TLS 1.3\n\n75.3%\n\nSecure\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n^ see § Cipher table above\n\n^ see § Web browsers and § Attacks against TLS/SSL sections\n\n\nWeb browsers[edit]\nThis section needs additional citations for verification.

TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are disabled by default on the latest versions of all major browsers.\nMitigations against known attacks are not enough yet:\n\nMitigations against POODLE attack: some browsers already prevent fallback to SSL 3.0; however, this mitigation needs to be supported by not only clients but also servers. Disabling SSL 3.0 itself, implementation of \"anti-POODLE record splitting\", or denying CBC ciphers in SSL 3.0 is required.\nGoogle Chrome: complete (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 33, fallback to SSL 3.0 is disabled since version 39, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default since version 40. Support of SSL 3.0 itself was dropped since version 44.)\nMozilla Firefox: complete (support of SSL 3.0 itself is dropped since version 39. SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default and fallback to SSL 3.0 are disabled since version 34, TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 35. In ESR, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default and TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since ESR 31.3.0.)\nInternet Explorer: partial (only in version 11, SSL 3.0 is disabled by default since April 2015. Version 10 and older are still vulnerable against POODLE.)\nOpera: complete (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV is implemented since version 20, \"anti-POODLE record splitting\", which is effective only with client-side implementation, is implemented since version 25, SSL 3.0 itself is disabled by default since version 27. Support of SSL 3.0 itself will be dropped since version 31.)\nSafari: complete (only on OS X 10.8 and later and iOS 8, CBC ciphers during fallback to SSL 3.0 is denied, but this means it will use RC4, which is not recommended as well. Support of SSL 3.0 itself is dropped on OS X 10.11 and later and iOS 9.)\nMitigation against RC4 attacks:\nGoogle Chrome disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 43. RC4 is disabled since Chrome 48.\nFirefox disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 36. Firefox 44 disabled RC4 by default.\nOpera disabled RC4 except as a fallback since version 30. RC4 is disabled since Opera 35.\nInternet Explorer for Windows 7/Server 2008 R2 and for Windows 8/Server 2012 have set the priority of RC4 to lowest and can also disable RC4 except as a fallback through registry settings. Internet Explorer 11 Mobile 11 for Windows Phone 8.1 disable RC4 except as a fallback if no other enabled algorithm works. Edge [Legacy] and IE 11 disable RC4 completely in August 2016.\nMitigation against FREAK attack:\nThe Android Browser included with Android 4.0 and older is still vulnerable to the FREAK attack.\nInternet Explorer 11 Mobile is still vulnerable to the FREAK attack.\nGoogle Chrome, Internet Explorer (desktop), Safari (desktop & mobile), and Opera (mobile) have FREAK mitigations in place.\nMozilla Firefox on all platforms and Google Chrome on Windows were not affected by FREAK.\nLibraries[edit]\nMain article: Comparison of TLS implementationsFurther information on protocol version support in libraries: Comparison of TLS implementations § TLS version support\nMost SSL and TLS programming libraries are free and open-source software.\n\nBoringSSL, a fork of OpenSSL for Chrome/Chromium and Android as well as other Google applications.\nBotan, a BSD-licensed cryptographic library written in C++.\nBSAFE Micro Edition Suite: a multi-platform implementation of TLS written in C using a FIPS-validated cryptographic module\nBSAFE SSL-J: a TLS library providing both a proprietary API and JSSE API, using FIPS-validated cryptographic module\ncryptlib: a portable open source cryptography library (includes TLS/SSL implementation)\nDelphi programmers may use a library called Indy which utilizes OpenSSL or alternatively ICS which supports TLS 1.3 now.\nGnuTLS: a free implementation (LGPL licensed)\nJava Secure Socket Extension (JSSE): the Java API and provider implementation (named SunJSSE)[106]\nLibreSSL: a fork of OpenSSL by OpenBSD project.\nMatrixSSL: a dual licensed implementation\nMbed TLS (previously PolarSSL): A tiny SSL library implementation for embedded devices that is designed for ease of use\nNetwork Security Services: FIPS 140 validated open source library\nOpenSSL: a free implementation (BSD license with some extensions)\nSchannel: an implementation of SSL and TLS Microsoft Windows as part of its package.\nSecure Transport: an implementation of SSL and TLS used in OS X and iOS as part of their packages.\nwolfSSL (previously CyaSSL): Embedded SSL/TLS Library with a strong focus on speed and size.\nA paper presented at the 2012 ACM conference on computer and communications security[107] showed that many applications used some of these SSL libraries incorrectly, leading to vulnerabilities. According to the authors:\n\n\"The root cause of most of these vulnerabilities is the terrible design of the APIs to the underlying SSL libraries. Instead of expressing high-level security properties of network tunnels such as confidentiality and authentication, these APIs expose low-level details of the SSL protocol to application developers. As a consequence, developers often use SSL APIs incorrectly, misinterpreting and misunderstanding their manifold parameters, options, side effects, and return values.\"\nOther uses[edit]\nThe Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) can also be protected by TLS. These applications use public key certificates to verify the identity of endpoints.\nTLS can also be used for tunneling an entire network stack to create a VPN, which is the case with OpenVPN and OpenConnect. Many vendors have by now married TLS's encryption and authentication capabilities with authorization. There has also been substantial development since the late 1990s in creating client technology outside of Web-browsers, in order to enable support for client/server applications. Compared to traditional IPsec VPN technologies, TLS has some inherent advantages in firewall and NAT traversal that make it easier to administer for large remote-access populations.\nTLS is also a standard method for protecting Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) application signaling. TLS can be used for providing authentication and encryption of the SIP signaling associated with VoIP and other SIP-based applications.[108]\n\nSecurity[edit]\nAttacks against TLS/SSL[edit]\nSignificant attacks against TLS/SSL are listed below.\nIn February 2015, IETF issued an informational RFC[109] summarizing the various known attacks against TLS/SSL.\n\nRenegotiation attack[edit]\nA vulnerability of the renegotiation procedure was discovered in August 2009 that can lead to plaintext injection attacks against SSL 3.0 and all current versions of TLS.[110] For example, it allows an attacker who can hijack an https connection to splice their own requests into the beginning of the conversation the client has with the web server. The attacker cannot actually decrypt the client–server communication, so it is different from a typical man-in-the-middle attack. A short-term fix is for web servers to stop allowing renegotiation, which typically will not require other changes unless client certificate authentication is used. To fix the vulnerability, a renegotiation indication extension was proposed for TLS.[111] It will require the client and server to include and verify information about previous handshakes in any renegotiation handshakes.[112] This extension has been implemented by several libraries.[113][114][115]\n\nDowngrade attacks: FREAK attack and Logjam attack[edit]\nMain articles: Downgrade attack, FREAK, and Logjam (computer security)\nA protocol downgrade attack (also called a version rollback attack) tricks a web server into negotiating connections with previous versions of TLS (such as SSLv2) that have long since been abandoned as insecure.\nPrevious modifications to the original protocols, like False Start[116] (adopted and enabled by Google Chrome[117]) or Snap Start, reportedly introduced limited TLS protocol downgrade attacks[118] or allowed modifications to the cipher suite list sent by the client to the server. In doing so, an attacker might succeed in influencing the cipher suite selection in an attempt to downgrade the cipher suite negotiated to use either a weaker symmetric encryption algorithm or a weaker key exchange.[119] A paper presented at an ACM conference on computer and communications security in 2012 demonstrated that the False Start extension was at risk: in certain circumstances it could allow an attacker to recover the encryption keys offline and to access the encrypted data.[120]\nEncryption downgrade attacks can force servers and clients to negotiate a connection using cryptographically weak keys. In 2014, a man-in-the-middle attack called FREAK was discovered affecting the OpenSSL stack, the default Android web browser, and some Safari browsers.[121] The attack involved tricking servers into negotiating a TLS connection using cryptographically weak 512 bit encryption keys.\nLogjam is a security exploit discovered in May 2015 that exploits the option of using legacy \"export-grade\" 512-bit Diffie–Hellman groups dating back to the 1990s.[122] It forces susceptible servers to downgrade to cryptographically weak 512-bit Diffie–Hellman groups. An attacker can then deduce the keys the client and server determine using the Diffie–Hellman key exchange.\n\nCross-protocol attacks: DROWN[edit]\nMain article: DROWN attack\nThe DROWN attack is an exploit that attacks servers supporting contemporary SSL/TLS protocol suites by exploiting their support for the obsolete, insecure, SSLv2 protocol to leverage an attack on connections using up-to-date protocols that would otherwise be secure.[123][124] DROWN exploits a vulnerability in the protocols used and the configuration of the server, rather than any specific implementation error. Full details of DROWN were announced in March 2016, together with a patch for the exploit. At that time, more than 81,000 of the top 1 million most popular websites were among the TLS protected websites that were vulnerable to the DROWN attack.[124]\n\nBEAST attack[edit]\nOn September 23, 2011, researchers Thai Duong and Juliano Rizzo demonstrated a proof of concept called BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS)[125] using a Java applet to violate same origin policy constraints, for a long-known cipher block chaining (CBC) vulnerability in TLS 1.0:[126][127] an attacker observing 2 consecutive ciphertext blocks C0, C1 can test if the plaintext block P1 is equal to x by choosing the next plaintext block P2 = x ⊕ C0 ⊕ C1; as per CBC operation, C2 = E(C1 ⊕ P2) = E(C1 ⊕ x ⊕ C0 ⊕ C1) = E(C0 ⊕ x), which will be equal to C1 if x = P1. Practical exploits had not been previously demonstrated for this vulnerability, which was originally discovered by Phillip Rogaway[128] in 2002. The vulnerability of the attack had been fixed with TLS 1.1 in 2006, but TLS 1.1 had not seen wide adoption prior to this attack demonstration.\nRC4 as a stream cipher is immune to BEAST attack. Therefore, RC4 was widely used as a way to mitigate BEAST attack on the server side. However, in 2013, researchers found more weaknesses in RC4. Thereafter enabling RC4 on server side was no longer recommended.[129]\nChrome and Firefox themselves are not vulnerable to BEAST attack,[130][131] however, Mozilla updated their NSS libraries to mitigate BEAST-like attacks. NSS is used by Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome to implement SSL. Some web servers that have a broken implementation of the SSL specification may stop working as a result.[132]\nMicrosoft released Security Bulletin MS12-006 on January 10, 2012, which fixed the BEAST vulnerability by changing the way that the Windows Secure Channel (Schannel) component transmits encrypted network packets from the server end.[133] Users of Internet Explorer (prior to version 11) that run on older versions of Windows (Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2008 R2) can restrict use of TLS to 1.1 or higher.\nApple fixed BEAST vulnerability by implementing 1/n-1 split and turning it on by default in OS X Mavericks, released on October 22, 2013.[134]\n\n CRIME and BREACH attacks[edit]\nMain articles: CRIME and BREACH\nThe authors of the BEAST attack are also the creators of the later CRIME attack, which can allow an attacker to recover the content of web cookies when data compression is used along with TLS.[135][136] When used to recover the content of secret authentication cookies, it allows an attacker to perform session hijacking on an authenticated web session.\nWhile the CRIME attack was presented as a general attack that could work effectively against a large number of protocols, including but not limited to TLS, and application-layer protocols such as SPDY or HTTP, only exploits against TLS and SPDY were demonstrated and largely mitigated in browsers and servers. The CRIME exploit against HTTP compression has not been mitigated at all, even though the authors of CRIME have warned that this vulnerability might be even more widespread than SPDY and TLS compression combined. In 2013 a new instance of the CRIME attack against HTTP compression, dubbed BREACH, was announced. Based on the CRIME attack a BREACH attack can extract login tokens, email addresses or other sensitive information from TLS encrypted web traffic in as little as 30 seconds (depending on the number of bytes to be extracted), provided the attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious web link or is able to inject content into valid pages the user is visiting (ex: a wireless network under the control of the attacker).[137] All versions of TLS and SSL are at risk from BREACH regardless of the encryption algorithm or cipher used.[138] Unlike previous instances of CRIME, which can be successfully defended against by turning off TLS compression or SPDY header compression, BREACH exploits HTTP compression which cannot realistically be turned off, as virtually all web servers rely upon it to improve data transmission speeds for users.[137] This is a known limitation of TLS as it is susceptible to chosen-plaintext attack against the application-layer data it was meant to protect.\n\nTiming attacks on padding[edit]\nEarlier TLS versions were vulnerable against the padding oracle attack discovered in 2002. A novel variant, called the Lucky Thirteen attack, was published in 2013.\nSome experts[98] also recommended avoiding triple DES CBC. Since the last supported ciphers developed to support any program using Windows XP's SSL/TLS library like Internet Explorer on Windows XP are RC4 and Triple-DES, and since RC4 is now deprecated (see discussion of RC4 attacks), this makes it difficult to support any version of SSL for any program using this library on XP.\nA fix was released in 2014 as the Encrypt-then-MAC extension to the TLS specification.[139] The Lucky Thirteen attack can be mitigated in TLS 1.2 by using only AES_GCM ciphers; AES_CBC remains vulnerable. SSL may safeguard email, VoIP, and other types of communications over insecure networks in addition to its primary use case of secure data transmission between a client and the server.[2]\n\nPOODLE attack[edit]\nMain article: POODLE\nOn October 14, 2014, Google researchers published a vulnerability in the design of SSL 3.0, which makes CBC mode of operation with SSL 3.0 vulnerable to a padding attack (CVE-2014-3566). They named this attack POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption). On average, attackers only need to make 256 SSL 3.0 requests to reveal one byte of encrypted messages.[105]\nAlthough this vulnerability only exists in SSL 3.0 and most clients and servers support TLS 1.0 and above, all major browsers voluntarily downgrade to SSL 3.0 if the handshakes with newer versions of TLS fail unless they provide the option for a user or administrator to disable SSL 3.0 and the user or administrator does so[citation needed]. Therefore, the man-in-the-middle can first conduct a version rollback attack and then exploit this vulnerability.[105]\nOn December 8, 2014, a variant of POODLE was announced that impacts TLS implementations that do not properly enforce padding byte requirements.[140]\n\nRC4 attacks[edit]\nMain article: RC4 § Security\nDespite the existence of attacks on RC4 that broke its security, cipher suites in SSL and TLS that were based on RC4 were still considered secure prior to 2013 based on the way in which they were used in SSL and TLS. In 2011, the RC4 suite was actually recommended as a workaround for the BEAST attack.[141] New forms of attack disclosed in March 2013 conclusively demonstrated the feasibility of breaking RC4 in TLS, suggesting it was not a good workaround for BEAST.[104] An attack scenario was proposed by AlFardan, Bernstein, Paterson, Poettering and Schuldt that used newly discovered statistical biases in the RC4 key table[142] to recover parts of the plaintext with a large number of TLS encryptions.[143][144] An attack on RC4 in TLS and SSL that requires 13 × 220 encryptions to break RC4 was unveiled on 8 July 2013 and later described as \"feasible\" in the accompanying presentation at a USENIX Security Symposium in August 2013.[145][146] In July 2015, subsequent improvements in the attack make it increasingly practical to defeat the security of RC4-encrypted TLS.[147]\nAs many modern browsers have been designed to defeat BEAST attacks (except Safari for Mac OS X 10.7 or earlier, for iOS 6 or earlier, and for Windows; see § Web browsers), RC4 is no longer a good choice for TLS 1.0. The CBC ciphers which were affected by the BEAST attack in the past have become a more popular choice for protection.[98] Mozilla and Microsoft recommend disabling RC4 where possible.[148][149] In februari 2015, the use of RC4 cipher suites was officially prohibited in all versions of TLS.[101]\nOn September 1, 2015, Microsoft, Google, and Mozilla announced that RC4 cipher suites would be disabled by default in their browsers (Microsoft Edge [Legacy], Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7/8.1/10, Firefox, and Chrome) in early 2016.[150][151][152]\n\nTruncation attack[edit]\nA TLS (logout) truncation attack blocks a victim's account logout requests so that the user unknowingly remains logged into a web service. When the request to sign out is sent, the attacker injects an unencrypted TCP FIN message (no more data from sender) to close the connection. The server therefore does not receive the logout request and is unaware of the abnormal termination.[153]\nPublished in July 2013,[154][155] the attack causes web services such as Gmail and Hotmail to display a page that informs the user that they have successfully signed-out, while ensuring that the user's browser maintains authorization with the service, allowing an attacker with subsequent access to the browser to access and take over control of the user's logged-in account. The attack does not rely on installing malware on the victim's computer; attackers need only place themselves between the victim and the web server (e.g., by setting up a rogue wireless hotspot).[153] This vulnerability also requires access to the victim's computer.\nAnother possibility is when using FTP the data connection can have a false FIN in the data stream, and if the protocol rules for exchanging close_notify alerts is not adhered to a file can be truncated.\n\nPlaintext attack against DTLS[edit]\nIn February 2013 two researchers from Royal Holloway, University of London discovered a timing attack[156] which allowed them to recover (parts of the) plaintext from a DTLS connection using the OpenSSL or GnuTLS implementation of DTLS when Cipher Block Chaining mode encryption was used.\n\nUnholy PAC attack[edit]\nThis attack, discovered in mid-2016, exploits weaknesses in the Web Proxy Autodiscovery Protocol (WPAD) to expose the URL that a web user is attempting to reach via a TLS-enabled web link.[157] Disclosure of a URL can violate a user's privacy, not only because of the website accessed, but also because URLs are sometimes used to authenticate users. Document sharing services, such as those offered by Google and Dropbox, also work by sending a user a security token that is included in the URL. An attacker who obtains such URLs may be able to gain full access to a victim's account or data.\nThe exploit works against almost all browsers and operating systems.\n\nSweet32 attack[edit]\nThe Sweet32 attack breaks all 64-bit block ciphers used in CBC mode as used in TLS by exploiting a birthday attack and either a man-in-the-middle attack or injection of a malicious JavaScript into a web page. The purpose of the man-in-the-middle attack or the JavaScript injection is to allow the attacker to capture enough traffic to mount a birthday attack.[158]\n\nImplementation errors: Heartbleed bug, BERserk attack, Cloudflare bug[edit]\nMain articles: Heartbleed and Cloudbleed\nThe Heartbleed bug is a serious vulnerability specific to the implementation of SSL/TLS in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, affecting versions 1.0.1 to 1.0.1f. This weakness, reported in April 2014, allows attackers to steal private keys from servers that should normally be protected.[159] The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of the OpenSSL software. This compromises the secret private keys associated with the public certificates used to identify the service providers and to encrypt the traffic, the names and passwords of the users and the actual content. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate services and users.[160] The vulnerability is caused by a buffer over-read bug in the OpenSSL software, rather than a defect in the SSL or TLS protocol specification.\nIn September 2014, a variant of Daniel Bleichenbacher's PKCS#1 v1.5 RSA Signature Forgery vulnerability[161] was announced by Intel Security Advanced Threat Research. This attack, dubbed BERserk, is a result of incomplete ASN.1 length decoding of public key signatures in some SSL implementations, and allows a man-in-the-middle attack by forging a public key signature.[162]\nIn February 2015, after media reported the hidden pre-installation of superfish adware on some Lenovo notebooks,[163] a researcher found a trusted root certificate on affected Lenovo machines to be insecure, as the keys could easily be accessed using the company name, Komodia, as a passphrase.[164] The Komodia library was designed to intercept client-side TLS/SSL traffic for parental control and surveillance, but it was also used in numerous adware programs, including Superfish, that were often surreptitiously installed unbeknownst to the computer user. In turn, these potentially unwanted programs installed the corrupt root certificate, allowing attackers to completely control web traffic and confirm false websites as authentic.\nIn May 2016, it was reported that dozens of Danish HTTPS-protected websites belonging to Visa Inc. were vulnerable to attacks allowing hackers to inject malicious code and forged content into the browsers of visitors.[165] The attacks worked because the TLS implementation used on the affected servers incorrectly reused random numbers (nonces) that are intended to be used only once, ensuring that each TLS handshake is unique.[165]\nIn February 2017, an implementation error caused by a single mistyped character in code used to parse HTML created a buffer overflow error on Cloudflare servers. Similar in its effects to the Heartbleed bug discovered in 2014, this overflow error, widely known as Cloudbleed, allowed unauthorized third parties to read data in the memory of programs running on the servers—data that should otherwise have been protected by TLS.[166]\n\nSurvey of websites vulnerable to attacks[edit]\nAs of July 2021[update], the Trustworthy Internet Movement estimated the ratio of websites that are vulnerable to TLS attacks.[103]\n\n\nSurvey of the TLS vulnerabilities of the most popular websites\n\n\nAttacks\n\nSecurity\n\n\nInsecure\n\nDepends\n\nSecure\n\nOther\n\n\nRenegotiation attack\n\n< 0.1%support insecure renegotiation\n\n< 0.1%support both\n\n99.7%support secure renegotiation\n\n0.3%no support\n\n\nRC4 attacks\n\n0.2%support RC4 suites used with modern browsers\n\n3.0%support some RC4 suites\n\n96.9%no support\n\n—\n\n\nTLS Compression (CRIME attack)\n\n0%vulnerable\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nHeartbleed\n\n0%vulnerable\n\n—\n\n—\n\n—\n\n\nChangeCipherSpec injection attack\n\n< 0.1%vulnerable and exploitable\n\n< 0.1%vulnerable, not exploitable\n\n99.5%not vulnerable\n\n0.4%unknown\n\n\nPOODLE attack against TLS(Original POODLE against SSL 3.0 is not included)\n\n< 0.1%vulnerable and exploitable\n\n—\n\n99.9%not vulnerable\n\n0.1%unknown\n\n\nProtocol downgrade\n\n4.1%Downgrade defence not supported\n\n—\n\n80.2%Downgrade defence supported\n\n15.7%unknown\n\nForward secrecy[edit]\nMain article: Forward secrecy\nForward secrecy is a property of cryptographic systems which ensures that a session key derived from a set of public and private keys will not be compromised if one of the private keys is compromised in the future.[167] Without forward secrecy, if the server's private key is compromised, not only will all future TLS-encrypted sessions using that server certificate be compromised, but also any past sessions that used it as well (provided that these past sessions were intercepted and stored at the time of transmission).[168] An implementation of TLS can provide forward secrecy by requiring the use of ephemeral Diffie–Hellman key exchange to establish session keys, and some notable TLS implementations do so exclusively: e.g., Gmail and other Google HTTPS services that use OpenSSL.[169] However, many clients and servers supporting TLS (including browsers and web servers) are not configured to implement such restrictions.[170][171] In practice, unless a web service uses Diffie–Hellman key exchange to implement forward secrecy, all of the encrypted web traffic to and from that service can be decrypted by a third party if it obtains the server's master (private) key; e.g., by means of a court order.[172]\nEven where Diffie–Hellman key exchange is implemented, server-side session management mechanisms can impact forward secrecy. The use of TLS session tickets (a TLS extension) causes the session to be protected by AES128-CBC-SHA256 regardless of any other negotiated TLS parameters, including forward secrecy ciphersuites, and the long-lived TLS session ticket keys defeat the attempt to implement forward secrecy.[173][174][175] Stanford University research in 2014 also found that of 473,802 TLS servers surveyed, 82.9% of the servers deploying ephemeral Diffie–Hellman (DHE) key exchange to support forward secrecy were using weak Diffie–Hellman parameters. These weak parameter choices could potentially compromise the effectiveness of the forward secrecy that the servers sought to provide.[176]\nSince late 2011, Google has provided forward secrecy with TLS by default to users of its Gmail service, along with Google Docs and encrypted search, among other services.[177]\nSince November 2013, Twitter has provided forward secrecy with TLS to users of its service.[178] As of August 2019[update], about 80% of TLS-enabled websites are configured to use cipher suites that provide forward secrecy to most web browsers.[103]\n\nTLS interception[edit]\nSee also: Server Name Indication § Encrypted Client Hello\nTLS interception (or HTTPS interception if applied particularly to that protocol) is the practice of intercepting an encrypted data stream in order to decrypt it, read and possibly manipulate it, and then re-encrypt it and send the data on its way again. This is done by way of a \"transparent proxy\": the interception software terminates the incoming TLS connection, inspects the HTTP plaintext, and then creates a new TLS connection to the destination.[179]\nTLS/HTTPS interception is used as an information security measure by network operators in order to be able to scan for and protect against the intrusion of malicious content into the network, such as computer viruses and other malware.[179] Such content could otherwise not be detected as long as it is protected by encryption, which is increasingly the case as a result of the routine use of HTTPS and other secure protocols.\nA significant drawback of TLS/HTTPS interception is that it introduces new security risks of its own. One notable limitation is that it provides a point where network traffic is available unencrypted thus giving attackers an incentive to attack this point in particular in order to gain access to otherwise secure content. The interception also allows the network operator, or persons who gain access to its interception system, to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against network users. A 2017 study found that \"HTTPS interception has become startlingly widespread, and that interception products as a class have a dramatically negative impact on connection security\".[179]\n\nProtocol details[edit]\nThe TLS protocol exchanges records, which encapsulate the data to be exchanged in a specific format (see below). Each record can be compressed, padded, appended with a message authentication code (MAC), or encrypted, all depending on the state of the connection. Each record has a content type field that designates the type of data encapsulated, a length field and a TLS version field. The data encapsulated may be control or procedural messages of the TLS itself, or simply the application data needed to be transferred by TLS. The specifications (cipher suite, keys etc.) required to exchange application data by TLS, are agreed upon in the \"TLS handshake\" between the client requesting the data and the server responding to requests. The protocol therefore defines both the structure of payloads transferred in TLS and the procedure to establish and monitor the transfer.\n\nTLS handshake[edit]\nSimplified illustration of the full TLS 1.2 handshake with timing information\nWhen the connection starts, the record encapsulates a \"control\" protocol – the handshake messaging protocol (content type 22). This protocol is used to exchange all the information required by both sides for the exchange of the actual application data by TLS. It defines the format of messages and the order of their exchange. These may vary according to the demands of the client and server – i.e., there are several possible procedures to set up the connection. This initial exchange results in a successful TLS connection (both parties ready to transfer application data with TLS) or an alert message (as specified below).\n\nBasic TLS handshake[edit]\nA typical connection example follows, illustrating a handshake where the server (but not the client) is authenticated by its certificate:\n\nNegotiation phase:\nA client sends a ClientHello message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and suggested compression methods. If the client is attempting to perform a resumed handshake, it may send a session ID. If the client can use Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation, it may include a list of supported application protocols, such as HTTP/2.\nThe server responds with a ServerHello message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. To confirm or allow resumed handshakes the server may send a session ID. The chosen protocol version should be the highest that both the client and server support. For example, if the client supports TLS version 1.1 and the server supports version 1.2, version 1.1 should be selected; version 1.2 should not be selected.\nThe server sends its Certificate message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server).[180]\nThe server sends its ServerKeyExchange message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server). This message is sent for all DHE, ECDHE and DH_anon cipher suites.[25]\nThe server sends a ServerHelloDone message, indicating it is done with handshake negotiation.\nThe client responds with a ClientKeyExchange message, which may contain a PreMasterSecret, public key, or nothing. (Again, this depends on the selected cipher.) This PreMasterSecret is encrypted using the public key of the server certificate.\nThe client and server then use the random numbers and PreMasterSecret to compute a common secret, called the \"master secret\". All other key data (session keys such as IV, symmetric encryption key, MAC key[181]) for this connection is derived from this master secret (and the client- and server-generated random values), which is passed through a carefully designed pseudorandom function.\nThe client now sends a ChangeCipherSpec record, essentially telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption parameters were present in the server certificate).\" The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol with content type of 20.\nThe client sends an authenticated and encrypted Finished message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\nThe server will attempt to decrypt the client's Finished message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be terminated.\nFinally, the server sends a ChangeCipherSpec, telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted, if encryption was negotiated).\"\nThe server sends its authenticated and encrypted Finished message.\nThe client performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the server did in the previous step.\nApplication phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be authenticated and optionally encrypted exactly like in their Finished message. Otherwise, the content type will return 25 and the client will not authenticate.\nClient-authenticated TLS handshake[edit]\nThe following full example shows a client being authenticated (in addition to the server as in the example above; see mutual authentication) via TLS using certificates exchanged between both peers.\n\nNegotiation Phase:\nA client sends a ClientHello message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and compression methods.\nThe server responds with a ServerHello message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. The server may also send a session id as part of the message to perform a resumed handshake.\nThe server sends its Certificate message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server).[180]\nThe server sends its ServerKeyExchange message (depending on the selected cipher suite, this may be omitted by the server). This message is sent for all DHE, ECDHE and DH_anon ciphersuites.[1]\nThe server sends a CertificateRequest message, to request a certificate from the client.\nThe server sends a ServerHelloDone message, indicating it is done with handshake negotiation.\nThe client responds with a Certificate message, which contains the client's certificate, but not its private key.\nThe client sends a ClientKeyExchange message, which may contain a PreMasterSecret, public key, or nothing. (Again, this depends on the selected cipher.) This PreMasterSecret is encrypted using the public key of the server certificate.\nThe client sends a CertificateVerify message, which is a signature over the previous handshake messages using the client's certificate's private key. This signature can be verified by using the client's certificate's public key. This lets the server know that the client has access to the private key of the certificate and thus owns the certificate.\nThe client and server then use the random numbers and PreMasterSecret to compute a common secret, called the \"master secret\". All other key data (\"session keys\") for this connection is derived from this master secret (and the client- and server-generated random values), which is passed through a carefully designed pseudorandom function.\nThe client now sends a ChangeCipherSpec record, essentially telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption was negotiated). \"The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol and has type 20 and not 22.\nFinally, the client sends an encrypted Finished message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\nThe server will attempt to decrypt the client's Finished message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be torn down.\nFinally, the server sends a ChangeCipherSpec, telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be authenticated (and encrypted if encryption was negotiated).\"\nThe server sends its own encrypted Finished message.\nThe client performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the server did in the previous step.\nApplication phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be encrypted exactly like in their Finished message.\nResumed TLS handshake[edit]\nPublic key operations (e.g., RSA) are relatively expensive in terms of computational power. TLS provides a secure shortcut in the handshake mechanism to avoid these operations: resumed sessions. Resumed sessions are implemented using session IDs or session tickets.\nApart from the performance benefit, resumed sessions can also be used for single sign-on, as it guarantees that both the original session and any resumed session originate from the same client. This is of particular importance for the FTP over TLS/SSL protocol, which would otherwise suffer from a man-in-the-middle attack in which an attacker could intercept the contents of the secondary data connections.[182]\n\nTLS 1.3 handshake[edit]\nThe TLS 1.3 handshake was condensed to only one round trip compared to the two round trips required in previous versions of TLS/SSL.\nTo start the handshake, the client guesses which key exchange algorithm will be selected by the server and sends a ClientHello message to the server containing a list of supported ciphers (in order of the client's preference) and public keys for some or all of its key exchange guesses. If the client successfully guesses the key exchange algorithm, 1 round trip is eliminated from the handshake. After receiving the ClientHello, the server selects a cipher and sends back a ServerHello with its own public key, followed by server Certificate and Finished messages.[183]\nAfter the client receives the server's finished message, it now is coordinated with the server on which cipher suite to use.[184]\n\nSession IDs[edit]\nIn an ordinary full handshake, the server sends a session id as part of the ServerHello message. The client associates this session id with the server's IP address and TCP port, so that when the client connects again to that server, it can use the session id to shortcut the handshake. In the server, the session id maps to the cryptographic parameters previously negotiated, specifically the \"master secret\". Both sides must have the same \"master secret\" or the resumed handshake will fail (this prevents an eavesdropper from using a session id). The random data in the ClientHello and ServerHello messages virtually guarantee that the generated connection keys will be different from in the previous connection. In the RFCs, this type of handshake is called an abbreviated handshake. It is also described in the literature as a restart handshake.\n\nNegotiation phase:\nA client sends a ClientHello message specifying the highest TLS protocol version it supports, a random number, a list of suggested cipher suites and compression methods. Included in the message is the session id from the previous TLS connection.\nThe server responds with a ServerHello message, containing the chosen protocol version, a random number, cipher suite and compression method from the choices offered by the client. If the server recognizes the session id sent by the client, it responds with the same session id. The client uses this to recognize that a resumed handshake is being performed. If the server does not recognize the session id sent by the client, it sends a different value for its session id. This tells the client that a resumed handshake will not be performed. At this point, both the client and server have the \"master secret\" and random data to generate the key data to be used for this connection.\nThe server now sends a ChangeCipherSpec record, essentially telling the client, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be encrypted.\" The ChangeCipherSpec is itself a record-level protocol and has type 20 and not 22.\nFinally, the server sends an encrypted Finished message, containing a hash and MAC over the previous handshake messages.\nThe client will attempt to decrypt the server's Finished message and verify the hash and MAC. If the decryption or verification fails, the handshake is considered to have failed and the connection should be torn down.\nFinally, the client sends a ChangeCipherSpec, telling the server, \"Everything I tell you from now on will be encrypted.\"\nThe client sends its own encrypted Finished message.\nThe server performs the same decryption and verification procedure as the client did in the previous step.\nApplication phase: at this point, the \"handshake\" is complete and the application protocol is enabled, with content type of 23. Application messages exchanged between client and server will also be encrypted exactly like in their Finished message.\nSession tickets[edit]\nInstead of session IDs, TLS can also be extended via use of session tickets.[185] It defines a way to resume a TLS session without requiring that session-specific state is stored at the TLS server.\nWhen using session tickets, the TLS server stores its session-specific state in a session ticket and sends the session ticket to the TLS client for storing. The client resumes a TLS session by sending the session ticket to the server, and the server resumes the TLS session according to the session-specific state in the ticket. The session ticket is encrypted and authenticated by the server, and the server verifies its validity before using its contents.\nOne particular weakness of this method with OpenSSL is that it always limits encryption and authentication security of the transmitted TLS session ticket to AES128-CBC-SHA256, no matter what other TLS parameters were negotiated for the actual TLS session.[174] This means that the state information (the TLS session ticket) is not as well protected as the TLS session itself.

However, this message can be sent at any time during the handshake and up to the closure of the session.

If the alert level is flagged as a warning, the remote can decide to close the session if it decides that the session is not reliable enough for its needs (before doing so, the remote may also send its own signal).\n\n\nAlert TLS record format\n\n\nOffset\n\nOctet\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\nOctet\n\nBit\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\n22\n\n23\n\n24\n\n25\n\n26\n\n27\n\n28\n\n29\n\n30\n\n31\n\n\n0\n\n0\n\nContent Type (21)\n\nLegacy version (major/minor)\n\nLength (2)↴\n\n\n4\n\n32\n\n↪Length (cont.)\n\nLevel\n\nDescription\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n64\n\nMAC (optional)\n\n\n12\n\n96\n\n\n⋮\n\n⋮\n\n\n⋮\n\n⋮\n\nPadding (block ciphers only)\n\nContent Type: 8 bits; == 21\nThis field indicates the Alert Protocol Type.\nLength: 16 bits; == 2\nThe length of the rest of fields, which is 2.\nLevel: 8 bits\nThis field identifies the level of alert.

Otherwise, the recipient may decide to terminate the session itself, by sending its own fatal alert and closing the session itself immediately after sending it. The use of Alert records is optional, however if it is missing before the session closure, the session may be resumed automatically (with its handshakes).\nNormal closure of a session after termination of the transported application should preferably be alerted with at least the Close notify Alert type (with a simple warning level) to prevent such automatic resume of a new session. Signalling explicitly the normal closure of a secure session before effectively closing its transport layer is useful to prevent or detect attacks (like attempts to truncate the securely transported data, if it intrinsically does not have a predetermined length or duration that the recipient of the secured data may expect).\n\nAlert level types\n\n\nCode\n\nLevel type\n\nConnection state\n\n\n1\n\nwarning\n\nconnection or security may be unstable.\n\n\n2\n\nfatal\n\nconnection or security may be compromised, or an unrecoverable error has occurred.\n\nDescription: 8 bits\nThis field identifies which type of alert is being sent.\n\nAlert description types\n\n\nCode\n\nDescription\n\nLevel types\n\nNote\n\n\n0\n\nClose notify\n\nwarning/fatal\n\n\n\n\n10\n\nUnexpected message\n\nfatal\n\n\n\n\n20\n\nBad record MAC\n\nfatal\n\nPossibly a bad SSL implementation, or payload has been tampered with e.g. FTP firewall rule on FTPS server.\n\n\n21\n\nDecryption failed\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only, reserved\n\n\n22\n\nRecord overflow\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n30\n\nDecompression failure\n\nfatal\n\n\n\n\n40\n\nHandshake failure\n\nfatal\n\n\n\n\n41\n\nNo certificate\n\nwarning/fatal\n\nSSL 3.0 only, reserved\n\n\n42\n\nBad certificate\n\nwarning/fatal\n\n\n\n\n43\n\nUnsupported certificate\n\nwarning/fatal\n\ne.g. certificate has only server authentication usage enabled and is presented as a client certificate\n\n\n44\n\nCertificate revoked\n\nwarning/fatal\n\n\n\n\n45\n\nCertificate expired\n\nwarning/fatal\n\nCheck server certificate expire also check no certificate in the chain presented has expired\n\n\n46\n\nCertificate unknown\n\nwarning/fatal\n\n\n\n\n47\n\nIllegal parameter\n\nfatal\n\n\n\n\n48\n\nUnknown CA (Certificate authority)\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n49\n\nAccess denied\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only – e.g. no client certificate has been presented (TLS: Blank certificate message or SSLv3: No Certificate alert), but server is configured to require one.\n\n\n50\n\nDecode error\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n51\n\nDecrypt error\n\nwarning/fatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n60\n\nExport restriction\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only, reserved\n\n\n70\n\nProtocol version\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n71\n\nInsufficient security\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n80\n\nInternal error\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n86\n\nInappropriate fallback\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n90\n\nUser canceled\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n100\n\nNo renegotiation\n\nwarning\n\nTLS only\n\n\n110\n\nUnsupported extension\n\nwarning\n\nTLS only\n\n\n111\n\nCertificate unobtainable\n\nwarning\n\nTLS only\n\n\n112\n\nUnrecognized name\n\nwarning/fatal\n\nTLS only; client's Server Name Indicator specified a hostname not supported by the server\n\n\n113\n\nBad certificate status response\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n114\n\nBad certificate hash value\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only\n\n\n115\n\nUnknown PSK identity\n\nfatal\n\nTLS only.

The length (in bytes) of the MAC is indicated by the letter q.\nPadding: variable (optional)\nThe last byte contains the padding length.\nSupport for name-based virtual servers[edit]\nFrom the application protocol point of view, TLS belongs to a lower layer, although the TCP/IP model is too coarse to show it. This means that the TLS handshake is usually (except in the STARTTLS case) performed before the application protocol can start. In the name-based virtual server feature being provided by the application layer, all co-hosted virtual servers share the same certificate because the server has to select and send a certificate immediately after the ClientHello message. This is a big problem in hosting environments because it means either sharing the same certificate among all customers or using a different IP address for each of them.\nThere are two known workarounds provided by X.509:\n\nIf all virtual servers belong to the same domain, a wildcard certificate can be used.[186] Besides the loose host name selection that might be a problem or not, there is no common agreement about how to match wildcard certificates. Different rules are applied depending on the application protocol or software used.[187]\nAdd every virtual host name in the subjectAltName extension. The major problem being that the certificate needs to be reissued whenever a new virtual server is added.\nTo provide the server name, Transport Layer Security (TLS) Extensions allow clients to include a Server Name Indication extension (SNI) in the extended ClientHello message.[188]: §3  This extension hints to the server immediately which name the client wishes to connect to, so the server can select the appropriate certificate to send to the clients.\nThere is also a method to implement name-based virtual hosting by upgrading HTTP to TLS via an HTTP/1.1 Upgrade header.[2] Normally this is to securely implement HTTP over TLS within the main \"http\" URI scheme instead of the commonly used \"https\" scheme. This would avoid forking the URI space and reduces the number of used ports, however, few implementations currently support this.[citation needed]\n\nSee also[edit]\nApplication-Layer Protocol Negotiation – a TLS extension used for SPDY and TLS False Start\nBullrun (decryption program) – a secret anti-encryption program run by the U.S. National Security Agency\nCertificate authority\nCertificate Transparency\nDatagram TLS (DTLS)\nDelegated credential\nHTTP Strict Transport Security – HSTS\nKey ring file\nPrivate Communications Technology (PCT) – a historic Microsoft competitor to SSL 2.0\nQUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) – \"…was designed to provide security protection equivalent to TLS/SSL\"; QUIC's main goal is to improve perceived performance of connection-oriented web applications that are currently using TCP\nServer-Gated Cryptography\ntcpcrypt\nDatagram Transport Layer Security\nTLS acceleration\nFurther reading[edit]\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to SSL and TLS.\n\nWagner, David; Schneier, Bruce (November 1996). \"Analysis of the SSL 3.0 Protocol\" (PDF).

However, a high court exercises its original civil and criminal jurisdiction only if the subordinate courts are not authorized by law to try such matters for lack of peculiar or territorial jurisdiction. High courts may also enjoy original jurisdiction in certain matters, if so designated, especially[1] by the constitution, a state law or union law.\nThe work of most high courts primarily consists of adjudicating on appeals from lower courts and writ petitions in terms of Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution. Writ jurisdiction is also the original jurisdiction of a high court.\nEach state is divided into judicial districts presided over by a district judge and a session judge. He is known as the district judge when he presides over a civil case and the session's judge when he presides over a criminal case. He is the highest judicial authority below a high court judge. Below him, there are courts of civil jurisdiction, known by different names in different states. Under Article 141 of the constitution, all courts in India, including high courts – are bound by the judgements and orders of the Supreme Court of India by precedence.\nJudges in a high court are appointed by the president of India in consultation with the chief justice of India and the governor of the state under Article 217, Chapter Five of Part VI of the Constitution, but through subsequent judicial interpretations, the primacy of the appointment process is on the hands of the Judicial Collegium. High courts are headed by a chief justice. The chief justices rank fourteenth (within their respective states) and seventeenth (outside their respective states) on the Indian order of precedence. The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average, or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that high court, whichever is higher.\nThe Calcutta High Court is the oldest high court in the country, brought into existence on 14 May 1862.[2] High courts that handle numerous cases of a particular region have permanent benches established there. Benches are also present in states which come under the jurisdiction of a court outside its territorial limits. Smaller states with few cases may have circuit benches established. Circuit benches (known as circuit courts in some parts of the world) are temporary courts which hold proceedings for a few selected months in a year. Thus cases built up during this interim period are judged when the circuit court is in session. According to a study conducted by Bangalore-based N.G.O, Daksh, on 21 high courts in collaboration with the Ministry of Law and Justice in March 2015, it was found that average pendency of a case in high courts in India is 3 years.[3]\nThe buildings of Bombay High Court (as part of the Victorian and art deco ensemble of Mumbai) and Punjab and Haryana High Court (as part of the architectural work of Le Corbusier) are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\nThe high courts are substantially different from and should not be confused with the state courts of other federations, in that the Constitution of India includes detailed provisions for the uniform organisation and operation of all high courts.[4]  In other federations like the United States, state courts are formed under the constitutions of the separate states and as a result vary greatly from state to state.[4]\n\n\nHigh courts[edit]\nThe Calcutta High Court in Kolkata (est. 1862), Bombay High Court in Mumbai (est. 1862), Madras High Court in Chennai (est. 1862), Allahabad High Court in Allahabad (est. 1866), and Bangalore High Court (now Karnataka High Court) in Bengaluru (est. 1884) are the five oldest high courts in India. The Andhra Pradesh High Court and Telangana High Court are the newest high courts, established on 1 January 2019 according to the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014.\nThe following are the 25 high courts in India, sorted by name, year established, act by which it was established, jurisdiction, principal seat (headquarters), permanent benches (subordinate to the principal seat), circuit benches (functional a few days in a month/year), the maximum number of judges sanctioned, and the presiding chief justice of the high

        "content": "Deities or spirits of the underworld\n\"Chthonic\" redirects here. For the band, see Chthonic (band). For other uses, see Chthon (disambiguation).\nA relief from grave of Lysimachides, 320 BC. Two men and two women sit together as Charon, the ferryman of the Underworld, approaches to take them to the land of the dead.\nIn Greek mythology, deities referred to as chthonic (/ˈθɒnɪk/) or chthonian (/ˈθoʊniən/)[a] were gods or spirits who inhabited the underworld or existed in or under the earth, and were typically associated with death or fertility.[2] The terms chthonic and chthonian are derived from the Ancient Greek word χθών (khthṓn) meaning 'earth' or 'soil'. The Greek adjective χθόνιος (khthónios) means 'in, under, or beneath the earth', which can be differentiated from γῆ (gê), which refers to the living surface of land on the earth.[3][4][5] In Greek, χθόνιος (khthónios) is a descriptive word for things relating to the underworld,[6] which was in antiquity sometimes applied as an epithet to deities such as Hermes, Demeter, and Zeus.[7]\nThe chthonic deities have been compared to the more commonly referred-to Olympic gods and their associated rites and cults. Olympic gods are understood to reference that which exists above the earth, particularly in the sky.[8] Gods that are related to agriculture are also considered to have chthonic associations as planting and growing take place in part under the earth.[9]\n\n\nRelationship to Olympian deities[edit]\nOrestes Pursued by the Furies painted by William-Adolphe Bouguereau, 1862\nChthonic and ouranic (or Olympic) are not completely opposite descriptors.[10] They do not cleanly differentiate types of gods and worship into distinct categories, but represent a cultic spectrum.[11] These terms communicate associations with the underworld and/or agriculture. This makes some deities such as Hades, Persephone, and the Erinyes more likely to be considered chthonic due to their proximity to the underworld.[12]\nWhile this is the case, virtually any god could be considered chthonic to emphasize different aspects of the god.[13] For example, Demeter and Hermes are categorized within the twelve Olympian gods but are often considered chthonic.[8] Zeus has also been referenced with the surname \"chthonios\", demonstrating the situational use of a chthonic description.[14]\n\nEpithets[edit]\nThe Return of Persephone, 1891, by Frederic Leighton\nIn Ancient Greece, the names of deities were sometimes followed by an epithet, similar in concept to a surname. In this context, the purpose of an epithet was to describe a characteristic or association of a deity. The epithets 'chthonios' and 'chthonia' would follow the name of a god or goddess to reference their relationship either to the underworld or agriculture.[6]\nFor example, Hermes Chthonios references Hermes' role as the underworld escort. In contrast, Charon does not necessitate a chthonic epithet as his relation to the underworld is his main attribution. Additional examples of deities with recorded epithets include Demeter Chthonia, Ge Chthonia, Persephone Chthonia, Zeus Chthonios, and Hecate Chthonia.[6]\n\nCommon chthonic deities[edit]\nAs discussed, many deities can be considered chthonic based upon what attributes are being referenced. Though this is the case, a few gods are most commonly considered chthonic due to their considerable role in the underworld and/or agriculture. These include Hades as he is the ruler of the underworld.[15] Persephone is the Queen of the Underworld alongside Hades. She spends half the year in the underworld and the other half above the earth. The period when Persephone is in the underworld corresponds with winter while she personifies spring when she returns to above the earth.[16]\nIt is for these reasons that she is mainly associated with the underworld as well as agriculture. Demeter is related to the underworld as she attempts to rescue Persephone from Hades in her grief. She is associated with agriculture and fertility.[16] The Furies, or the Erinyes, reside in the underworld and are known for vengeance.[17]\n\nChthonic cult[edit]\nOfferings were a significant aspect of Ancient Greek religion. They were used to communicate with the gods and commonly took the forms of sacrifice and libation.[18] Offerings were central to the worship of both chthonic and ouranic gods, though the specifics of these rituals differed. These differences provide insight into the ways in which Greeks perceived chthonic and ouranic deities as well as the ways they related to them.[19]\n\nSacrifice[edit]\nHagia Triada Sarcophagus, 1400 BC, Minoan fresco potentially depicting chthonic worship.\nOuranic sacrifices took place during the daytime and included wine as a libation. They were performed on high altars which resided outside of temples. The animal sacrifice was roasted with the smoke traveling upward toward the sky, in the direction of the Olympic gods. Once cooked, the worshippers would feast on the sacrifice with the idea that they were sharing this meal with the gods. The worshippers would eat the consumable portions of the animal and burn the rest for the god.[20] While performing the sacrifice, worshippers would raise their palms open and upward, again gesturing toward the sky where the ouranic gods resided.[21]\nChthonic sacrifice was commonly defined by offering a black or dark-hided animal to the deity. Worshippers did not consume the sacrifice themselves, but instead burned the entirety of the animal for the god.[22] This type of sacrifice is called a holocaust, defined by the completely burned and destroyed nature of the offering.[9] The sacrifice was performed on a low altar or in a pit in the ground, offered in the direction of the earth where chthonic deities would reside.[21] The animal sacrifice was sometimes buried as well.[22]\nThe temples in which these sacrifices were performed were typically built outside city walls with caves and grottos being popular locations, believed to be openings for chthonic deities.[23] Worshippers lowered their palms and faced them downwards toward the earth and underworld, in the direction of the chthonic gods. The goal of chthonic worship was to interact with gods beneath the earth so offerings were directed toward the ground to reach these deities.[21] For this reason, incense was not used in Chthonic worship, as the smoke would rise upwards rather than downwards. Wine was not utilized in this form of worship, but instead honey was a common libation used.[14]\nSacrificial practices would not always follow these exact patterns, but these are differences which can allude to whether the worshipper is conducting an ouranic or chthonic sacrifice.[6] Though the specifics of chthonic and ouranic sacrifice differ, they both have similar goals. In both scenarios, worshippers perform sacrifices to communicate and forge a relationship with the gods. They may perform a sacrifice to thank, honor, or request a favor from a god.[24]\n\nScholarly controversy[edit]\nThere is scholarly debate regarding whether the distinction of chthonic is historically accurate and/or useful. Some scholars, including van Straten, argue that the term is not archaeologically verifiable.[25] Some of these scholars believe that the modern use of chthonic is much more binary and concrete than it was in Ancient Greece.[6] Schlesier notes that discussions of chthonic practices often create a false sense of \"normal\" worship and \"deviant\" worship, again citing the stark binary which modern scholars may fall into.[10]\n\nIn response, Scullion articulates the benefits of the term chthonic as long as one also understands the fact that chthonic and Olympian are not mutually exclusive categories. The term serves to highlight differing aspects of religious practice.[9] Scholars emphasize the importance of reserving the label of chthonic for situations that were explicitly labeled as such in Ancient Greece.[26] \nNotes[edit]\n\n\n^ Also referred to as the chthonian gods[1] or the Greek chthonic deities.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\nCitations[edit]\n\n\n^ Parker, Robert (2015). \"chthonian gods\".

Dynasty IV lasted from c. 2613 to c. 2498 BC.[1] It was a time of peace and prosperity as well as one during which trade with other countries is officially documented.\nThe Fourth Dynasty heralded the height of the pyramid-building age. The peaceful rule of the Third Dynasty allowed artistic expressions to flourish.[2] Building experiments done by King Sneferu led to the evolution of mastaba tombs into the smooth-sided pyramids like those seen on the Giza Plateau. No other period in Egyptian history equaled the accomplishments achieved during the Fourth Dynasty.[3]\n\n\nRulers[edit]\n\nDynasty IV monarchs\n\n\nPersonal Name\nHorus-name\nImage\nReign\nPyramid\nSpouse(s)\n\n\nSneferu\"Soris\"\nNebma'at\n\nc. 2613 – c. 2589 BC\nRed Pyramid Bent Pyramid Pyramid at Meidum\nHetepheres I\n\n\nKhufu\"Cheops\"\nMedjedu\n\nc. 2589 – c. 2566 BC\nGreat Pyramid of Giza\nMeritites I Henutsen\n\n\nDjedefre\"Ratoises\"\nKheper\n\nc. 2566 – c. 2558 BC\nPyramid of Djedefre\nHetepheres II Khentetka\n\n\nKhafre\"Chephren\"\nUserib\n\nc. 2558 – c. 2532 BC\nPyramid of Khafre\nMeresankh III Khamerernebty IHekenuhedjet\n\n\nBikheris(Possibly Bakare or Baufre)\n\n\nc. 2570 BC\nPossibly Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet El Aryan\n\n\n\nMenkaure\"Mycerinus\"\nKakhet\n\nc. 2532 – c. 2503 BC\nPyramid of Menkaure\n\n\n\nShepseskaf\nShepsesket\n\nc. 2503 – c. 2498 BC\nMastabat al-Fir'aun\n\n\n\nThampthis(Existence disputed)\n\n\nc. 2500 BC\n\n\n\nSummary of Listed Kings[edit]\nSneferu[edit]\nMain article: Sneferu\nStatue of Sneferu, Cairo MuseumThe Red Pyramid of Sneferu, Dahshur, Egypt's first \"true\" smooth-sided pyramid\nSneferu, lauded as \"Bringer of Beauty\", \"Master of All Justice\", and \"Ruler of Lower and Upper Nile\", was the first pharaoh of the fourth dynasty. He descended from a family in Middle Egypt that lived near the city of Hermopolis, and most likely ascended to the throne by marrying a royal heiress. There is still debate as to who his father was, with the credit often being given to Huni, but this cannot be confirmed due to the break in dynasties. His mother, Meresankh I was either a lesser wife or concubine of Huni.\nUntil his reign, Egyptian kings were thought to be worldly incarnations of Horus, obtaining total deification exclusively in death. Sneferu was the first king to proclaim that he was the embodiment of Ra, a sun deity.\nSneferu built the Bent Pyramid, imitating King Djoser's tomb, approximately 150 years later.[4] The Red Pyramid is considered to be the first of the \"true\" pyramids built by Sneferu and earned the name due to its red coloration from the limestone used. Sneferu is attributed to constructing the Meidum pyramid, likely for the last king of the Third Dynasty, Huni.\nSneferu may also be responsible for a series of pyramids built in Selia, though no evidence dictates exactly who built them. He did commission a total of three pyramids during his reign.\nMany of Snerferu's political expeditions were to other countries to secure two things: a substantial labor force, through slavery, and access to a large store of building materials. He frequently traveled to Nubia, and Libya for these. The excursions into Nubia, and Libya allowed an extensive labor force to accumulate requiring vast amounts of food sources in order to maintain.\n\nKhufu[edit]\nMain article: Khufu\nStatue of Khufu/Cheops, Cairo Museum.\nKhufu, known to the Greek as Cheops, and Sneferu's successor—though it is unclear whether he was the biological son of Sneferu—was a widely known king. He is still known very well in present-day media, being featured in movies, novels, and television shows. His fame stems from his pyramid on the northeastern plateau at Giza, where he was buried. His mortuary temple was built on the northern end of the pyramid, which is no longer accessible due to grave robbers ravaging the area.\nOnly three-dimensional reliefs have been recovered and have lasted into modern day, including many limestone busts and clay figurines. Khufu's activities in and out of Egypt are not well documented, with the exception of his architecture. The Ancient Greeks remain some of the only texts referencing Khufu, through which they viewed him as a cruel and wicked man who offended the deities and forced his subjects into slavery.[5]\nKhufu, as the son of Sneferu, was believed to be illegitimate and therefore unworthy of the throne. Even if he was Sneferu's true son. He did very little to expand the country of Egypt and failed to follow his father's footsteps of territorial gains.\n\n\n\n\nKing Khufu built The Great Pyramid of Giza\n\n\n\nPrincess Nefertiabet, likely sister of Khufu, from her Giza tomb. Dated ca. 2580 BC. Louvre Museum E 15591\n\n\n\nPainted limestone Sphinx of Hetepheres II, a daughter of Khufu, possibly the first depiction of a sphinx\n\n\nDjedefre[edit]\nMain article: Djedefre\nBust of Djedefre, taken from a sphinx statue\nDjedefre is credited by historians with a reign of eight years. Not much is known of Djedefre, including his inconclusive lineage. It is possible that he is Khufu's son or that he was Khufu's brother. It is widely suggested that he is the son of a lesser queen who murdered the rightful heir to the throne and Djedefre's half brother, the crown prince Kawab.\nDjedefre chose to build his pyramid several kilometers north of Giza, creating speculation that there was a family feud that caused him to want to be far away from Khufu's tomb. A more favorable conclusion was that Djedefre chose to be buried closer to Iunu, the center of the cult of Ra.\nHis pyramid also features a statue of his wife, Hetepheres II, in the form of a sphinx. She was a daughter of Khufu and had been the wife of Kawab. It is sometimes suggested that this was the first true sphinx, although there is debate about the sphinx at Giza that was credited to Khafre. She became the longest living royal member of the dynasty, living into the reign of Shepseskaf.\n\nKhafre[edit]\nMain article: Khafre\nKhafre depicted with Horus\nKhafre, son of Khufu, succeeded his supposed brother, Djedefre, after his short reign. He chose to build his pyramid close to his father, matching it in style and being almost as large. At the front of the pyramid causeway lies the Great Sphinx that is said to bear his features. There is still debate on whether his Sphinx was erected before Djedefre's.[6] Khafre's sphinx was well-known and closer to his subjects, making it harder to determine which was built first due to biased record keeping.\nKhafre built the most amount of statues for Dynasty IV, leading to greater evidence of his 25 year long rule. He did cause controversy however, with his statue depicting his ties still to the god Horus, rather than Ra.[7]\n\nMenkaure[edit]\nMain article: Menkaure\nMenkaure and Khamerernebty II, his sister-wife\nMenkaure succeeded his father, Khafre, as King of Egypt. Menkaure is consistently depicted in his statuary as being around the personifications of deities, and nomes.\nHis pyramid is the third and smallest of those at Giza pyramid complex and is known as Netjer-er-Menkaure, which translates into \"Menkaure is Divine\". There was a sarcophagus found within the pyramid, that is approximately eight feet in length and three feet in height, made of basalt.\n\nShepseskaf[edit]\nMain article: Shepseskaf\nShepseskaf is generally accepted as the last king of the Fourth Dynasty, succeeding Menkaure. There is no conclusive evidence of who his mother is, though it is believed that he was the son of a minor queen. Who his wife was also is unknown.It is also uncertain of his relationship to Menkaure, and if he was a son or brother.\nShepseskaf broke the chain of pyramid building by the previous five kings. Instead of a pyramid, he chose to construct a mastaba, a rectangular block, which is commonly referred to as the Mastabat al-Fir’aun (\"Pharaoh's Bench\").[8]\n\nOther notable individuals[edit]\nBaka[edit]\nThe identification of Baka is unresolved.[9] Several ancient lists of kings have survived. They do not agree, however, and none of them may be considered complete. The Turin King List has a lacuna between Khafre and Menkaure, where the author had listed a king who reigned between these two pharaohs. The name of the king and length of the reign are completely lost in the lacuna.[10]\nThe Saqqara Tablet also notes a king between Khafre and Menkaure, but here too, the name is lost.[11]\nSome authorities have equated this king with Bikheris, on Manetho's list, who could correspond to the Egyptian name Baka or Bakare.\n\nKhentkaus I[edit]\nPerhaps the most intriguing evidence of the fourth dynasty is the status of Khentkaus I, also known as Khentykawes. She was a daughter of Menkaure and her tomb was built along the Menkaure causeway. She may have ruled as king.\nHer tomb is a large mastaba tomb, with another off-center mastaba placed above it. The second mastaba could not be centered over her primary mastaba because of the free, unsupported, space in the rooms below.\nOn a granite doorway leading into her tomb, Khentkaus I is given titles that may be read either as mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt, as mother of the king of upper and lower Egypt and king of upper and lower Egypt, or, as one scholar reads it, king of upper and lower Egypt and mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt.\nFurthermore, her depiction on this doorway also gives her the full trappings of kingship, including the false beard of the king. This depiction and the title given have led some Egyptologists to suggest that she reigned as king near the end of the fourth dynasty.\nHer tomb was finished in a characteristic niche style of architecture, however, the niches were later filled in with a smooth casing of limestone.\n\nChanges During the Fourth Dynasty[edit]\nAuthority of Kings[edit]\nOn the whole, Egypt was ruled by two centers of power—legal authority and traditional authority. Legal authority constituted governing by the king, not over the people directly, but via viziers and nomarchs. Traditional authority was derived from the concept that the deities gave a king the divine right to rule as he pleased. At its heart, the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian government became organized so that only the king could direct traditional authority.\n\nReligious changes[edit]\nStatue of Ranofer, High Priest of Ptah. End of Fourth, beginning of Fifth Dynasty, circa 2500 BC. Egyptian Museum, Cairo\nThe Fourth Dynasty is a period in which a shift in religious practices can be seen. Worship of the sun was becoming the common practice, as the Cult of Ra grew in size. The worship of the Sun was centered around the tomb of the king, Djedefre in the city Heliopolis,which had been occupied since predynastic times, and named by the Ancient Greeks.[12]\nDuring the era centralization of the nation's resources, material, organic, and human, began to develop a relationship to the king. The kings and their relation to the deities became unchallenged, with the kings carving their named into statues and monuments that had been previously reserved for deities. Khafre's famous statue, where a falcon was incorporated into his headgear, equated the king to the god Horus.\nKings no longer associated pyramids with the afterlife. The afterlife was once believed to be a divine kingdom that was represented as a type of idealistic heaven where only kings and pure hearts could go. Instead, the Fourth Dynasty represented a change in this idea, formulated the notion that the afterlife was a familiar place, taking the semblance of Earth.[13]\n\nChanging customs drove architectural changes[edit]\nRelief of Nofer and his Wife, detail. From Giza, tomb G2110, Dynasty 4, 2575–2465 BC.\nThe Old Kingdom saw a rise in the preservation of the deceased, making the preparation of bodies much more complex. The position of embalmer was created, and their jobs were solely to prepare a corpse in private. There were three ways to mummify a body: 1) Stucco: the body would be wrapped in fine linen and then covered in stucco plaster, the features of the body (including the face) were remodeled in the plaster;[14] 2) Linen: the body would be wrapped in linen, which was sometimes treated with natron (a mixture of multiple sodium carbonates[15]) and the linens would be treated with resin so that the features of the body could be modeled; and 3) Defleshing: removing all flesh and wrapping the bones in linens.[16] Generally, organs were removed which were then put into jars that would accompany the body in the tomb, and the inside of the body flushed out.\nTombs in the Fourth Dynasty changed drastically. \"Unimpressive\" graves did not satisfy the elites, meaning they would settle for smaller structures if the interior was decorated. Hieroglyphic writings were important to elites because, one, it was a lavish display of wealth and, two, it guided their souls to the afterlife. The Fourth Dynasty, however, did not have these writings. Instead, the tomb was deeper and super-structures were larger. After the Giza pyramid complex, later generations of tombs were more reasonably sized. After the Middle Kingdom, royals abandoned pyramids; they preferred graves that were carved into living rock of the Upper Egyptian mountains.\n\nAge of the Pyramids[edit]\nThe Age of the Pyramids refers to the fact that the Fourth Dynasty was the time when most of the well-known pyramids were built, which include those at Giza. King Sneferu was the first king to express an interest in funerary rites and tombs, which led him to the planning of the largest pyramid at Egypt. His first pyramids were called the Bent Pyramid and Red Pyramid. The \"Age of the Pyramids\" was not just about the building of large and easily recognizable structures, but also a change in funerary practices and rituals. This includes the burying of elites in large structures and the use of extensive mummification.\n\n Giza pyramid complex pyramids. From left to right: the Pyramid of Menkaure, Pyramid of Khafre, the Great Sphinx of Giza and Khufu's Great Pyramid of Giza\nComparison of regnal lists[edit]\nThe ancient king lists are in broad agreement on the order of most kings in this dynasty, though the obscure kings known Bikheris and Thamphthis were sometimes excluded. The Saqqara Tablet and Turin King List are both in fragmentary condition for this dynasty and some names and reign lengths have been lost as a result. The Saqqara Tablet has five missing cartouches between Khafre and Userkaf, the founder of the Fifth Dynasty. While up to four of these could be attributed to pharaohs recorded on other lists, it is unknown whose name would have appeared in the fifth cartouche, although Khentkaus I is a possibility.\nManetho's Aegyptiaca had a different order of kings for this dynasty: Sneferu, Khufu, Khafre, Menkaure, Djedefre, Bikheris, Shepseskaf and Thamphthis. This order places the reigns of the three pharaohs buried in the Giza pyramid complex next to each other, and all three kings are recorded reigning for over 60 years each.\n\n\n\nHistorical Pharaoh\n\nAbydos King List\n\nSaqqara Tablet\n\nTurin King List[17]\n\nManetho[18]\n\nReign Years\n\n\nTurin List[17]\n\nManetho[18]\n\n\nSneferu\n\nSneferu\n\nSneferu\n\nSnefer[u]\n\nSoris\n\n24\n\n29\n\n\nKhufu\n\nKhufu\n\nKhufu\n\nName lost\n\nSouphis\n\n23\n\n63\n\n\nDjedefre\n\nDjedefre\n\nDjedefre\n\nName lost\n\nRhatoises\n\n8\n\n25\n\n\nKhafre\n\nKhafre\n\nKhafre\n\nKha[fre]\n\nSouphis\n\nLost\n\n66\n\n\nBikheris\n\n–\n\nName lost\n\nName lost\n\nBikheres\n\nLost\n\n22\n\n\nMenkaure\n\nMenkaure\n\nName lost\n\nName lost\n\nMesochris\n\n28\n\n63\n\n\nShepseskaf\n\nShepseskaf\n\nName lost\n\nName lost\n\nSeberkheres\n\n4\n\n7\n\n\nThamphthis\n\n–\n\nName lost\n\n–\n\nThamphthis\n\n2\n\n9\n\nThird/Fourth dynasty genetics[edit]\nMain article: Old Kingdom individual (NUE001)\nFacial reconstruction and depiction created from the Nuwayrat individual skull.[19]\nNaturalistic contemporary rendering of Princess Nefertiabet, likely daughter of Sneferu and sister of king Khufu, ca. 2580 BCE.[20]\nFor the first time, in a 2025 publication by the scientific journal Nature, a whole-genome genetic study was able to give insights into the genetic background of Old Kingdom individuals, by sequencing the whole genome of an Old Kingdom adult male Egyptian of relatively high-status, radiocarbon-dated to 2855–2570 BCE, with funerary practices archeologically attributed to the Third and Fourth Dynasty, which was excavated in Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات), in a cliff 265 km south of Cairo.[21][22] Before this study, whole-genome sequencing of ancient Egyptians from the early periods of Egyptian Dynastic history had not yet been accomplished, mainly because of the problematic DNA preservation conditions in Egypt.[21]\n\nAncestry model of Egyptian genome from Nuwayrat.[21]\nThe corpse had been placed intact in a large circular clay pot without embalming, and then installed inside a cliff tomb, which accounts for the comparatively good level of conservation of the skeleton and its DNA.[21] Most of his genome was found to be associated with North African Neolithic ancestry, but about 20% of his genetic ancestry could be sourced to the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia.[21] The genetic profile was most closely represented by a two-source model, in which 77.6% ± 3.8% of the ancestry corresponded to genomes from the Middle Neolithic Moroccan site of Skhirat-Rouazi (dated to 4780–4230 BCE), which itself consists of predominantly (76.4 ± 4.0%) Levant Neolithic ancestry and (23.6 ± 4.0%) minor Iberomaurusian ancestry, while the remainder (22.4% ± 3.8%) was most closely related to known genomes from Neolithic Mesopotamia (dated to 9000-8000 BCE).[21][23] Genomes from the Neolithic/Chalcolithic Levant only appeared as a minor third-place component in three-source models.[21] A 2022 DNA study had already shown evidence of gene flow from the Mesopotamian and Zagros regions into surrounding areas, including Anatolia, during the Neolithic, but not as far as Egypt yet.[23]\nIn terms of chronology, Egypt was one of the first areas to adopt the Neolithic package emerging from West Asia as early as the 6th millennium BCE.[21] Population genetics in the Nile Valley observed a marked change around this period, as shown by odontometric and dental tissue changes.[21] Cultural exchange and trade between the two regions then continued through the 4th millennium BCE, as shown by the transfer of Mesopotamian Late Uruk period features to the Nile Valley of the later Predynastic Period.[21] Migrations flows from Mesopotamia accompanied such cultural exchanges, possibly through the sea routes of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea or through yet un-sampled intermediaries in the Levant, which could explain the relative smallness of genetic influence from known Chalcolithic/Bronze Age Levantines populations.[21]\nOverall, the 2025 study \"provides direct evidence of genetic ancestry related to the eastern Fertile Crescent in ancient Egypt\".[21] This genetic connection suggests that there had been ancient migration flows from the eastern Fertile Crescent to Egypt, in addition to the exchanges of objects and imagery (domesticated animals and plants, writing systems...) already observed.[21] This suggests a pattern of wide cultural and demographic expansion from the Mesopotamian region, which affected both Anatolia and Egypt during this period.[21]\n\nFourth Dynasty timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to 4th dynasty of Egypt.\n\nSee also[edit]\nEgyptian Fourth Dynasty Family Tree\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Shaw, Ian, ed.

They can, for example, allow private  communications to be sent across a public network (such as the Internet), or for one network protocol to be carried over an incompatible network, through a process called encapsulation.\nBecause tunneling involves repackaging the traffic data into a different form, perhaps with encryption as standard, it can hide the nature of the traffic that is run through a tunnel.\nTunneling protocols work by using the data portion of a packet (the payload) to carry the packets that actually provide the service. Tunneling uses a layered protocol model such as those of the OSI or TCP/IP protocol suite, but usually violates the layering when using the payload to carry a service not normally provided by the network. Typically, the delivery protocol operates at an equal or higher level in the layered model than the payload protocol.\n\n\nUses[edit]\nA tunneling protocol may, for example, allow a foreign protocol to run over a network that does not support that particular protocol, such as running IPv6 over IPv4.\nAnother important use is to provide services that are impractical or unsafe to be offered using only the underlying network services, such as providing a corporate network address to a remote user whose physical network address is not part of the corporate network.\n\nCircumventing firewall policy[edit]\nUsers can also use tunneling to \"sneak through\" a firewall, using a protocol that the firewall would normally block, but \"wrapped\" inside a protocol that the firewall does not block, such as HTTP.  If the firewall policy does not specifically exclude this kind of \"wrapping\", this trick can function to get around the intended firewall policy (or any set of interlocked firewall policies).\nAnother HTTP-based tunneling method uses the HTTP CONNECT method/command. A client issues the HTTP CONNECT command to an HTTP proxy.  The proxy then makes a TCP connection to a particular server:port, and relays data between that server:port and the client connection.[1] Because this creates a security hole, CONNECT-capable HTTP proxies commonly restrict access to the CONNECT method.  The proxy allows connections only to specific ports, such as 443 for HTTPS.[2]\nOther tunneling methods able to bypass network firewalls make use of different protocols such as DNS,[3] MQTT,[4] SMS.[5]\n\nTechnical overview[edit]\nAs an example of network layer over network layer, Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE), a protocol running over IP (IP protocol number 47), often serves to carry IP packets, with RFC 1918 private addresses, over the Internet using delivery packets with public IP addresses. In this case, the delivery and payload protocols are the same, but the payload addresses are incompatible with those of the delivery network.\nIt is also possible to establish a connection using the data link layer. The Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) allows the transmission of frames between two nodes. A tunnel is not encrypted by default: the TCP/IP protocol chosen determines the level of security.\nSSH uses port 22 to enable data encryption of payloads being transmitted over a public network (such as the Internet) connection, thereby providing VPN functionality. IPsec has an end-to-end Transport Mode, but can also operate in a tunneling mode through a trusted security gateway.\nTo understand a particular protocol stack imposed by tunneling, network engineers must understand both the payload and delivery protocol sets.\n\nCommon tunneling protocols[edit]\nIP in IP (IP protocol 4): IP in IPv4/IPv6\nSIT/IPv6 (IP protocol 41): IPv6 in IPv4/IPv6\nGRE (IP protocol 47): Generic Routing Encapsulation\nOpenVPN (UDP port 1194)\nSSTP (TCP port 443): Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol\nIPSec (IP protocols 50 and 51): Internet Protocol Security\nL2TP (UDP port 1701): Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol\nL2TPv3 (IP protocol 115): Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3\nVXLAN (UDP port 4789): Virtual Extensible Local Area Network\nPPTP (TCP port 1723 for control, GRE for data): Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\nPPPoE (EtherType 0x8863 for control, 0x8864 for data): Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet\nGENEVE\nWireGuard (UDP dynamic port)\nTCP meltdown problem[edit]\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (September 2024)\nTunneling a TCP-encapsulating payload (such as PPP) over a TCP-based connection (such as SSH's port forwarding) is known as \"TCP-over-TCP\", and doing so can induce a dramatic loss in transmission performance — known as the TCP meltdown problem,[6][7] which is why virtual private network (VPN) software may instead use a protocol simpler than TCP for the tunnel connection. TCP meltdown occurs when a TCP connection is stacked on top of another. The underlying layer may detect a problem and attempt to compensate, and the layer above it then overcompensates because of that, and this overcompensation causes said delays and degraded transmission performance.\n\nSecure Shell tunneling[edit]\nA Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel consists of an encrypted tunnel created through an SSH protocol connection. Users may set up SSH tunnels to transfer unencrypted traffic over a network through an encrypted channel.  It is a software-based approach to network security and the result is transparent encryption.[8]\nFor example, Microsoft Windows machines can share files using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, a non-encrypted protocol. If one were to mount a Microsoft Windows file-system remotely through the Internet, someone snooping on the connection could see transferred files. To mount the Windows file-system securely, one can establish a SSH tunnel that routes all SMB traffic to the remote fileserver through an encrypted channel. Even though the SMB protocol itself contains no encryption, the encrypted SSH channel through which it travels offers security.\n\nLocal and remote port forwarding with ssh executed on the blue computer\nOnce an SSH connection has been established, the tunnel starts with SSH listening to a port on the   remote or local host. Any connections to it are forwarded to the specified   address and port originating from the   opposing (remote or local, as previously) host.\nThe TCP meltdown problem is often not a problem when using OpenSSH's port forwarding, because many use cases do not entail TCP-over-TCP tunneling; the meltdown is avoided because the OpenSSH client processes the local, client-side TCP connection in order to get to the actual payload that is being sent, and then sends that payload directly through the tunnel's own TCP connection to the server side, where the OpenSSH server similarly \"unwraps\" the payload in order to \"wrap\" it up again for routing to its final destination.[9] Naturally, this wrapping and unwrapping also occurs in the reverse direction of the bidirectional tunnel.\nSSH tunnels provide a means to bypass firewalls that prohibit certain Internet services –  so long as a site allows outgoing connections. For example, an organization may prohibit a user from accessing Internet web pages (port 80) directly without passing through the organization's proxy filter (which provides the organization with a means of monitoring and controlling what the user sees through the web). But users may not wish to have their web traffic monitored or blocked by the organization's proxy filter. If users can connect to an external SSH server, they can create an SSH tunnel to forward a given port on their local machine to port 80 on a remote web server. To access the remote web server, users would point their browser to the local port at http://localhost/\nSome SSH clients support dynamic port forwarding that allows the user to create a SOCKS 4/5 proxy. In this case users can configure their applications to use their local SOCKS proxy server. This gives more flexibility than creating an SSH tunnel to a single port as previously described. SOCKS can free the user from the limitations of connecting only to a predefined remote port and server. If an application does not support SOCKS, a proxifier can be used to redirect the application to the local SOCKS proxy server. Some proxifiers, such as Proxycap, support SSH directly, thus avoiding the need for an SSH client.\nIn recent versions of OpenSSH it is even allowed to create layer 2 or layer 3 tunnels if both ends have enabled such tunneling capabilities. This creates tun (layer 3, default) or tap (layer 2) virtual interfaces on both ends of the connection. This allows normal network management and routing to be used, and when used on routers, the traffic for an entire subnetwork can be tunneled. A pair of tap virtual interfaces function like an Ethernet cable connecting both ends of the connection and can join kernel bridges.\n\nCyberattacks based on tunneling[edit]\nOver the years, tunneling and data encapsulation in general have been frequently adopted for malicious reasons, in order to maliciously communicate outside of a protected network.\nIn this context, known tunnels involve protocols such as HTTP,[10] SSH,[11] DNS,[12][13] MQTT.[14]\n\nSee also[edit]\nGPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP)\nHTTP tunnel\nICMP tunnel\nNVGRE\nOSI model (Diagram)\nPseudo-wire\nStunnel\nTunnel broker\nVirtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN)\nVirtual private network (VPN)\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ \"Upgrading to TLS Within HTTP/1.1\".

        "title": "Collegium system",
        "content": "Rulings on judicial independence in India\n\nThe collegium system is a collegium where incumbent judges of the Supreme Court of India appoint judges to the Judiciary of India. It originated from three Supreme Court judgments (rendered in 1981, 1993, and 1998), collectively known as the Three Judges Cases.[1] The system is alleged for being nepotistic.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\nEvolution of the concept[edit]\nThe three Judges Cases are:\n\nS. P. Gupta v. Union of India – 1981[2] (also known as the Judges' Transfer case)\nSupreme Court Advocates-on Record Association vs Union of India – 1993[3]\nIn re Special Reference 1 of 1998[4]\nOver the course of the three cases, the court evolved the principle of judicial independence to mean that no other branch of the state, including the legislature and the executive, would have any say in the appointment of judges. The court then created the collegium system, which has been in use since the judgment in the second Judges Case was issued in 1993.[3] The third Judges Case is not a case but an opinion delivered by the Supreme Court responding to a question of law regarding the collegium system, raised by then President of India K. R. Narayanan, in July 1998 under his constitutional powers.[4] There is no explicit mention of the collegium either in the original Constitution of India or in any successive amendments.\nIn January 2013, the court dismissed as without locus standi, a public interest litigation filed by NGO Suraz India Trust that sought to challenge the collegium system of appointment,[5] while in July, then Chief Justice P. Sathasivam spoke against any attempts to change the collegium system.[6][7]\n\nJudicial interpretation of the word \"recommendation\"[edit]\nIn the third Judges Case, the Supreme Court has elaborately dealt with the modality of rendering recommendation by a constitutional entity such as the Supreme Court, the President of India, etc. It is not at the discretion of the person consulted to render the recommendation but internal consultations with the peers shall be made in writing, and the recommendation shall be made in accordance with the internal consultations.[4] Here, internal consultations refer to panels of existing Supreme Court judges appointed by existing judges.\n\n2014 failed National Judicial Appointments Commission proposal[edit]\nOn 13 and 14 August 2014, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha respectively passed the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Bill, 2014 and the Constitution (121st Amendment) Bill, 2014, which amends articles 124(2) and 217(1) of the Constitution of India by establishing the National Judicial Appointments Commission, on whose recommendation the President would appoint judges to the higher judiciary[8] in order to scrap the collegium system. President Pranab Mukherjee gave his assent on 31 December 2014, after which the bills became National Judicial Appointments Commission Act, 2014 and the Constitution (99th Amendment) Act, 2014 respectively.\nHowever, on 16 October 2015, the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, consisting of Justices J. S. Khehar, Madan Lokur, Kurian Joseph, Adarsh Kumar Goel and Jasti Chelameswar, struck down the 99th constitutional amendment and the NJAC Act by a majority opinion of 4:1 in Supreme Court Advocate on Record Association v. Union of India, with Justice Chelameswar dissenting, restoring the previous collegium system.[9][10][11] The Bench declared that the Act is unconstitutional since it interfered with the autonomy of the judiciary by the executive which amounts to tampering with the basic structure of the constitution where Parliament is not empowered to change so. However, the Bench also acknowledged that the collegium system is lacking transparency and credibility which would be rectified or improved by the Judiciary.\n\nCurrent members of the Collegium[edit]\nHigh Court Elevation[edit]\n1.

J. K. Maheshwari, Judge of the Supreme Court.[12]\n5. B.V. Nagarathna, Judge of the Supreme Court.[12]\n\nCriticism[edit]\nThe collegium system is notorious for the nepotistic phenomenon called the uncle judge syndrome. In 2017, the Supreme Court of India had recognise the rot of the collegium, but as of 2025 little has been done to fix it.[13] In 2015, advocate Mathews J Nedumpara claims that around 50% of the High Court judges and 33% of the Supreme Court judges are family members of those in higher echelons of judiciary, with six Supreme Court judges were sons of former judges and over 88 High Court judges were either born to a family of lawyers, judges, or worked under some legal luminaries.[14] while in 2022, former Minister of State for Human Resource Development Upendra Kushwaha noted that judges of Supreme Court so far have come only from 250-300 families, and there is negligible representation of women and Scheduled Castes in the higher judiciary.[15] Consequently, the collegium system has often been alleged to have caste bias due to the lack of representation of marginalised communities such as the Other Backward Class, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.\n\nSee also[edit]\nCorruption in Indian judiciary\nNepotism\nNational Judicial Appointments Commission\nKesavananda Bharati v.

For the policy on vandalism, see Wikipedia:Vandalism. For advice on the use of mathematical proofs, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/Proofs.\n\n\nThis page documents an English Wikipedia policy.It describes a widely accepted standard that all editors should normally follow. Changes made to it should reflect consensus.ShortcutWP:VWP:V\nThis page in a nutshell: People must be able to check that facts and claims in Wikipedia articles are not just made up. This means each fact or claim must be attributable to reliable, published sources. Additionally, quotations and any facts or claims challenged or likely to be challenged must be supported by inline citations.\nContent policies\nNeutral point of view\nNo original research\nVerifiability\nArticle titles\nBiographies of living persons\nImage use policy\nWhat Wikipedia is not\n\nIn the English Wikipedia, verifiability means that people can check that facts or claims correspond to reliable sources. Wikipedia's content is determined by published information rather than editors' beliefs, experiences, or previously unpublished ideas or information. Even if you are sure something is true, it must have been previously published in a reliable source before you can add it.[a] If reliable sources disagree with each other, then maintain a neutral point of view and present what the various sources say, giving each side its due weight.\nEach fact or claim in an article must be verifiable. Additionally, four types of information must be accompanied by an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the material:\n\ndirect quotations,\nmaterial whose verifiability has been challenged,\nmaterial whose verifiability is likely to be challenged, and\ncontentious material about living and recently deceased persons.\nWhen material that needs an inline citation appears in two or more articles, an inline citation is needed in each.\nAny material that needs an inline citation but does not have one may be removed. Please immediately remove contentious material about living people (or existing groups) that is unsourced or poorly sourced.\nFor how to write citations, see citing sources. Verifiability, no original research, and neutral point of view are Wikipedia's core content policies. They work together to determine content, so editors should understand the key points of all three. Articles must also comply with the copyright policy.\n\n\nResponsibility for providing citations\nShortcutWP:BURDENWP:BURDEN\n\"WP:PROVEIT\" redirects here. For the editing tool, see Wikipedia:ProveIt.\n\"WP:CHALLENGE\" redirects here. For challenging closes, see Wikipedia:Closing discussions § Challenging a closure.\nSee also: Wikipedia:Editing policy § Try to fix problems\nAll content must be verifiable.  A fact or claim is \"verifiable\" if a reliable source that supports it could be cited, even if there is no citation for it in the article at the moment. The burden to demonstrate verifiability lies with the editor who adds or restores material, and it is satisfied by providing an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] the contribution.[c]\nThe cited source must clearly support the material as presented in the article. Cite the source clearly, ideally giving page number(s)—though sometimes a section, chapter, or other division may be appropriate instead; see Wikipedia:Citing sources for details of how to do this.\nFacts or claims without an inline citation to a reliable source that directly supports[b] them may be removed. They should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source. \nWhether or how quickly material should be removed for lacking an inline citation to a reliable source depends on the material and the overall state of the article. Consider adding a citation needed tag as an interim step to removing unsourced material, to allow references to be added.[d] When tagging or removing material for lacking an inline citation, state your concern that it may not be possible to find a published reliable source, and the material therefore may not be verifiable.[e] If you think the material is verifiable, you are encouraged to provide an inline citation yourself before removing or tagging it.\nDo not leave unsourced or poorly sourced material in an article if it might damage the reputation of living people or existing groups, and do not move it to the talk page. Be aware of how Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons also applies to groups.\n\n Reliable sources\nShortcutWP:SOURCEWP:SOURCE\n\"WP:SOURCE\" redirects here. For how to reference sources, see Help:Referencing for beginners.\nWhat counts as a reliable source\nFurther information: Wikipedia:Reliable sources\nA cited source on Wikipedia is often a specific portion of text (such as a short article or a page in a book). But when editors discuss sources (for example, to debate their appropriateness or reliability) they are usually talking about one or more related characteristics:\n\nThe work itself (the article, book) and works like it (\"An obituary can be a useful biographical source\", \"A recent source is better than an old one\")\nThe creator of the work (the writer, journalist: \"What do we know about that source's reputation?\") and people like them (\"A medical researcher is a better source than a journalist for medical claims\").\nThe publication (for example, the newspaper, journal, magazine: \"That source covers the arts.\") and publications like them (\"A newspaper is not a reliable source for medical claims\").\nThe publisher of the work (for example, Cambridge University Press: \"That source publishes reference works.\") and publishers like them (\"An academic publisher is a good source of reference works\").\nAll four can affect reliability.\nBase articles on reliable, independent, published sources with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Source material must be published, on Wikipedia meaning made available to the public in some form.[f] Unpublished material is not considered reliable. Use sources that directly support the material presented in an article and are appropriate to the claims made. The appropriateness of any source depends on the context. Be especially careful when sourcing content related to living people or medicine.\nIf available, academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources on topics such as history, medicine, and science.\nEditors may also use material from reliable non-academic sources, particularly if it appears in respected mainstream publications. Other reliable sources include:\n\nUniversity-level textbooks\nBooks published by respected publishing houses\nMainstream (non-fringe) magazines, including specialty ones\nReputable newspapers\nEditors may also use electronic media, subject to the same criteria (see details in Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources).\n\nBest sources\nThe best sources have a professional structure for checking or analyzing facts, legal issues, evidence, and arguments. The greater the degree of scrutiny given to these issues, the more reliable the source.\n\nNewspaper and magazine blogs\nShortcutWP:NEWSBLOGWP:NEWSBLOG\nSome newspapers, magazines, and other news organizations host online pages or columns they call blogs. These may be acceptable sources if the writers are professionals, but use them with caution because blogs may not be subject to the news organization's normal fact-checking process.[g] If a news organization publishes an opinion piece in a blog, attribute the statement to the writer, e.g. \"Jane Smith wrote ...\" Never use the blog comments that are left by the readers as sources. For personal or group blogs that are not reliable sources, see § Self-published sources below.\n\nReliable sources noticeboard and guideline\nFurther information: Wikipedia:Reliable sources and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard\nTo discuss the reliability of a specific source for a particular statement, consult Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard, which seeks to apply this policy to particular cases. For a guideline discussing the reliability of particular types of sources, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources. In case of conflict between this policy and the Wikipedia:Reliable sources guideline, or any other guideline related to sourcing, this policy has priority.\n\nSources that are usually not reliable\n\"WP:NOTRELIABLE\" redirects here. For Wikipedia's own reliability, see Wikipedia:Don't cite Wikipedia on Wikipedia.\nSee also: Wikipedia:Reliable sources § Questionable and self-published sources, and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources\nShortcutWP:NOTRSWP:NOTRS\nQuestionable sources\nQuestionable sources are those that have a poor reputation for checking the facts, lack meaningful editorial oversight, or have an apparent conflict of interest.\nSuch sources include websites and publications expressing views widely considered by other sources to be promotional, extremist, or that rely heavily on unsubstantiated gossip, rumor, or personal opinion. Questionable sources should be used only as sources for material on themselves, such as in articles about themselves; see below. They are not suitable sources for contentious claims.\nPredatory open access journals are questionable due to the absence of quality control in the peer-review process.\n\nSelf-published sources\nShortcutsWP:SPSWP:SPSWP:BLOGSWP:BLOGS\n\"WP:BLOG\" redirects here. For using someone's blog as a source for themselves, see WP:Biographies of living persons § Using the subject as a self-published source. For linking someone's blog in their article, see WP:External links § Official links.\nFurther information: Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons § Avoid self-published sources, Wikipedia:List of companies engaged in the self-publishing business, and Wikipedia:Identifying and using self-published works\n\"WP:WORDPRESS\" redirects here. For the use of Wordpress as a source, see WP:RSPWORDPRESS.\nAnyone can create a personal web page, self-publish a book, or claim to be an expert. Self-published material, such as books, patents, newsletters, personal websites, open wikis, personal or group blogs (as distinguished from newsblogs, above), content farms, podcasts, Internet forum postings, and social media postings, are largely not acceptable as sources. Self-published sources may be considered reliable if published by an established subject-matter expert, whose work in the relevant field has previously been published by reliable, independent publications.[g] Be careful when using such sources: if the information in question is suitable for inclusion, someone else will likely have published it in independent, reliable sources.[1] Never use self-published sources as third-party sources about living people, even if the author is an expert, well-known professional researcher, or writer.\n\nSelf-published or questionable sources as sources on themselves \n\"WP:SOCIALMEDIA\" redirects here. For the policy on what Wikipedia is not, see WP:NOTSOCIALMEDIA.\n\"WP:TWITTER\" redirects here. For the external links essay, see WP:Twitter-EL. For a template used for citing tweets, see Template:Cite tweet. For community evaluation of Twitter as a source, see Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Perennial sources § Twitter.\nSee also: Wikipedia:Reliable sources § Statements of opinion\nShortcutWP:ABOUTSELFWP:ABOUTSELF\nSelf-published and questionable sources may be used as sources of information about themselves, usually in articles about themselves or their activities, without the self-published source requirement that they are established experts in the field, so long as:\n\nThe material is neither unduly self-serving nor an exceptional claim;\nIt does not involve claims about third parties;\nIt does not involve claims about events not directly related to the source;\nThere is no reasonable doubt as to its authenticity; and\nThe article is not based primarily on such sources.\nThis policy also applies to material made public by the source on social networking websites such as Twitter, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Reddit, Instagram and Facebook.\n\nWikipedia and sources that mirror or use it\nShortcutsWP:CIRCULARWP:CIRCULARWP:CIRCWP:CIRC\n\"WP:CIRCULAR\" redirects here. For links on a page that redirect back to the same page, see MOS:CIRCULAR.\nSee also: WP:COPYWITHIN, Wikipedia:List of citogenesis incidents, Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia, Wikipedia:Don't cite Wikipedia on Wikipedia, and Wikipedia:ABOUTSELF\nDo not use articles from Wikipedia (whether English Wikipedia or Wikipedias in other languages) as sources, since Wikipedia is a user-generated source. Do not use websites mirroring Wikipedia content or publications relying on material from Wikipedia as sources. Content from a Wikipedia article is not considered reliable unless it is backed up by citing reliable sources. Confirm that these sources support the content, then use them directly.[2]\nAn exception is allowed when Wikipedia itself is being discussed in the article. These may cite content from Wikipedia or a sister project to support a statement about Wikipedia. Wikipedia or the sister project is a primary source in this case and may be used following the policy for primary sources. Any such use should avoid original research, undue emphasis on Wikipedia's role or views, and inappropriate self-reference. The article text should say that the material is sourced from Wikipedia.\n\nAccessibility\nAccess to sources\nShortcutWP:PAYWALLWP:PAYWALL\nSee also: Wikipedia:Offline sources and Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Cost\nDo not reject reliable sources just because they are difficult or costly to access. Some reliable sources are not easily accessible. For example, an online source may require payment, and a print-only source may be available only through libraries. Rare historical sources may even be available only in special museum collections and archives. If you have trouble accessing a source, others might do so for you (see WikiProject Resource Exchange).\n\nNon-English sources\nShortcutWP:NONENGWP:NONENG\nSee also: Wikipedia:Translators available and Wikipedia:No original research § Translations and transcriptions\nCiting\n\nCitations to non-English reliable sources are allowed on the English Wikipedia. However, because this project is in English, English-language sources are preferred over non-English ones when they are available and of equal quality and relevance. As with sources in English, if a dispute arises involving a citation to a non-English source, editors may request a quotation of relevant portions of the original source be provided, either in text, in a footnote, or on the article talk page.[h] (See Template:Request quotation.)\n\nQuoting\n\nIf you quote a non-English reliable source (whether in the main text or in a footnote), a translation into English should accompany the quote. Translations published by reliable sources are preferred over translations by Wikipedians, but translations by Wikipedians are preferred over machine translations. When using a machine translation of source material, editors should be reasonably certain that the translation is accurate and the source is appropriate. Editors should not rely upon machine translations of non-English sources in contentious articles or biographies of living people. If needed, ask an editor who can translate it for you.\nThe original text is usually included with the translated text in articles when translated by Wikipedians, and the translating editor is usually not cited. When quoting any material, whether in English or in some other language, be careful not to violate copyright; see the fair-use guideline.\n\nOther issues\nVerifiability does not guarantee inclusion\nShortcutWP:VNOTWP:VNOT\nMain page: Wikipedia:What Wikipedia is not § Encyclopedic content\nSee also: WP:UNDUE, WP:PAGEDECIDE, WP:SUMMARY, and WP:IINFO\nWhile information must be verifiable for inclusion in an article, not all verifiable information must be included. Consensus may determine that inclusion of a verifiable fact or claim does not improve an article, and other policies may indicate that the material is inappropriate. Such information should be omitted or presented instead in a different article.\n\nBuild consensus\nShortcutWP:ONUSWP:ONUS\n\"WP:ONUS\" redirects here. For the responsibility to demonstrate verifiability, see WP:BURDEN.\nThe responsibility for achieving consensus for inclusion is on those seeking to include disputed content.\n\nTagging a sentence, section, or article\nFurther information: Wikipedia:Citation needed and Wikipedia:Template index/Sources of articles\nIf you want to request an inline citation for an unsourced statement, you can tag a sentence with the {{citation needed}} template. You can also leave a note on the talk page asking for a source, or move the material to the talk page and ask for a source there. To request verification that a reference supports the text, tag it with {{verification needed}}. Material that fails verification may be tagged with {{failed verification}} or removed. It helps other editors to explain your rationale for using templates to tag material in the template, edit summary, or on the talk page.\nTake special care with contentious material about living and recently deceased people. Unsourced or poorly sourced material that is contentious, especially text that is negative, derogatory, or potentially damaging, should be removed immediately rather than tagged or moved to the talk page.\n\nExceptional claims require exceptional sourcing\n\n\nShortcutsWP:REDFLAGWP:REDFLAGWP:EXCEPTIONALWP:EXCEPTIONALWP:ECREEWP:ECREE\nSee also: Wikipedia:Fringe theories\nAny exceptional claim requires multiple high-quality sources.[3] Warnings (red flags) that should prompt extra caution include:\n\nSurprising or apparently important claims not covered by multiple mainstream sources;\nChallenged claims that are supported purely by primary or self-published sources or those with an apparent conflict of interest;\nReports of a statement by someone that seems out of character or against an interest they had previously defended;\nClaims contradicted by the prevailing view within the relevant community or that would significantly alter mainstream assumptions—especially in science, medicine, history, politics, and biographies of living and recently deceased people. This is especially true when proponents say there is a conspiracy to silence them.\nVerifiability and other principles\nCopyright and plagiarism\nFurther information: Wikipedia:Copyright, Wikipedia:Plagiarism, Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia, Wikipedia:MOS § Attribution, and Wikipedia:CITE § In-text attribution\nShortcutWP:OWNWORDSWP:OWNWORDS\nDo not plagiarize or breach copyright when using sources. Summarize source material in your own words as much as possible; when quoting or closely paraphrasing a source, use an inline citation, and in-text attribution where appropriate.\nDo not link to any source that violates the copyrights of others per contributors' rights and obligations. You can link to websites that display copyrighted works as long as the website has licensed the work or uses the work in a way compliant with fair use. Knowingly directing others to material that violates copyright may be considered contributory copyright infringement. If there is reason to think a source violates copyright, do not cite it. This is particularly relevant when linking to sites such as Scribd or YouTube, where due care should be taken to avoid linking to material violating copyright.\n\nNeutrality\nFurther information: Wikipedia:Neutral point of view\nShortcutWP:SOURCESDIFFERWP:SOURCESDIFFER\nEven when information is cited to reliable sources, you must present it with a neutral point of view (NPOV). Articles should be based on thorough research of sources. All articles must adhere to NPOV, fairly representing all majority and significant-minority viewpoints published by reliable sources, in rough proportion to the prominence of each view. Tiny-minority views need not be included, except in articles devoted to them. If there is a disagreement between sources, use in-text attribution: \"John Smith argues X, while Paul Jones maintains Y,\" followed by an inline citation. Sources themselves do not need to maintain a neutral point of view. Indeed, many reliable sources are not neutral. Our job as editors is simply to summarize what reliable sources say.\n\nNotability\nFurther information: Wikipedia:Notability\nIf no reliable, independent sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it (i.e., the topic is not notable).\nHowever, notability is based on the existence of suitable sources, not on the state of sourcing in an article.\n\nOriginal research\nFurther information: Wikipedia:No original research\nThe no original research policy (NOR) is closely related to the Verifiability policy. Among its requirements are:\n\nAll material in Wikipedia articles must be attributable to a reliable published source. This means a reliable published source must exist for it, whether or not it is cited in the article.\nSources must support the material clearly and directly: drawing inferences from multiple sources to advance a novel position is prohibited by the NOR policy.[h]\nBase articles largely on reliable secondary sources. While primary sources are appropriate in some cases, relying on them can be problematic. For more information, see the Primary, secondary, and tertiary sources section of the NOR policy, and the Misuse of primary sources section of the BLP policy.\nSee also\nGuidelines\nReliable sources\nIdentifying reliable sources (medicine)\nInformation pages\n\nWikipedia is not a reliable source\nHow to mine a source\nIndependent sources\nIdentifying and using primary sources\nIdentifying and using self-published works\nVideo links\nWhen to cite\n\nResources\nBacklog – links to articles that need citations added\nTemplate index/Sources of articles – maintenance templates for articles with sourcing problems\nThe Wikipedia Library – free access to newspapers, journals, and magazines for experienced editors\nWikiProject Resource Exchange – where you can ask for help with checking an individual source\nEssays\n\nCitation overkill\nIdentifying and using tertiary sources\nVerifiability does not guarantee inclusion\nVerifiability, not truth\nYou are not a reliable source\n\nNotes\n\n\n^ This principle was historically expressed as \"the threshold for inclusion is verifiability, not truth\". See the essay, Wikipedia:Verifiability, not truth.\n\n^ a b c A source \"directly supports\" a given piece of material if the information is present explicitly in the source, so that using this source to support the material is not a violation of Wikipedia:No original research. The location of any citation—including whether one is present in the article at all—is unrelated to whether a source directly supports the material. For questions about where and how to place citations, see Wikipedia:Citing sources, Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section § Citations, etc.\n\n^ Once an editor has provided any source they believe, in good faith, to be sufficient, then any editor who later removes the material must articulate specific problems that would justify its exclusion from Wikipedia (e.g., why the source is unreliable; the source does not support the claim; undue emphasis; unencyclopedic content; etc.). If necessary, all editors are then expected to help achieve consensus, and any problems with the text or sourcing should be fixed before the material is added back.\n\n^ When an article contains a lot of uncited information, it may be impractical to add specific {{citation needed}} tags. Consider then tagging a section with {{unreferenced section}}, or the article with the applicable of either {{unreferenced}} or {{more citations needed}}. For a disputed category, you may use {{unreferenced category}}. For a disambiguation page, consider asking for a citation on the talk page.\n\n^ When tagging or removing such material, please communicate your reasons why. Some editors object to others making frequent and large-scale deletions of unsourced information, especially if unaccompanied by other efforts to improve the material. Do not concentrate only on material of a particular point of view, as that may appear to be a contravention of Wikipedia:Neutral point of view. Also, check to see whether the material is sourced to a citation elsewhere on the page. For all these reasons, it is advisable to clearly communicate that you have a considered reason to believe the material in question cannot be verified.\n\n^ This includes material such as documents in publicly accessible archives as well as inscriptions in plain sight, e.g. tombstones.\n\n^ a b Note that any exceptional claim would require exceptional sources.\n\n^ a b When there is a dispute as to whether a piece of text is fully supported by a given source, direct quotes and other relevant details from the source should be provided to other editors as a courtesy. Do not violate the source's copyright when doing so.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n^ Self-published material is characterized by the lack of independent reviewers (those without a conflict of interest) validating the reliability of the content. Further examples of self-published sources include press releases, the material contained within company websites, advertising campaigns, material published in media by the owner(s)/publisher(s) of the media group, self-released music albums, and electoral manifestos:\nThe University of California, Berkeley, library states: \"Most pages found in general search engines for the web are self-published or published by businesses small and large with motives to get you to buy something or believe a point of view. Even within university and library web sites, there can be many pages that the institution does not try to oversee.\"\nPrinceton University offers this understanding in its publication, Academic Integrity at Princeton (2011): \"Unlike most books and journal articles, which undergo strict editorial review before publication, much of the information on the Web is self-published. To be sure, there are many websites in which you can have confidence: mainstream newspapers, refereed electronic journals, and university, library, and government collections of data.

Dynasty IV lasted from c. 2613 to c. 2498 BC.[1] It was a time of peace and prosperity as well as one during which trade with other countries is officially documented.\nThe Fourth Dynasty heralded the height of the pyramid-building age. The peaceful rule of the Third Dynasty allowed artistic expressions to flourish.[2] Building experiments done by King Sneferu led to the evolution of mastaba tombs into the smooth-sided pyramids like those seen on the Giza Plateau. No other period in Egyptian history equaled the accomplishments achieved during the Fourth Dynasty.[3]\n\n\nRulers[edit]\n\nDynasty IV monarchs\n\n\nPersonal Name\nHorus-name\nImage\nReign\nPyramid\nSpouse(s)\n\n\nSneferu\"Soris\"\nNebma'at\n\nc. 2613 – c. 2589 BC\nRed Pyramid Bent Pyramid Pyramid at Meidum\nHetepheres I\n\n\nKhufu\"Cheops\"\nMedjedu\n\nc. 2589 – c. 2566 BC\nGreat Pyramid of Giza\nMeritites I Henutsen\n\n\nDjedefre\"Ratoises\"\nKheper\n\nc. 2566 – c. 2558 BC\nPyramid of Djedefre\nHetepheres II Khentetka\n\n\nKhafre\"Chephren\"\nUserib\n\nc. 2558 – c. 2532 BC\nPyramid of Khafre\nMeresankh III Khamerernebty IHekenuhedjet\n\n\nBikheris(Possibly Bakare or Baufre)\n\n\nc. 2570 BC\nPossibly Unfinished Northern Pyramid of Zawyet El Aryan\n\n\n\nMenkaure\"Mycerinus\"\nKakhet\n\nc. 2532 – c. 2503 BC\nPyramid of Menkaure\n\n\n\nShepseskaf\nShepsesket\n\nc. 2503 – c. 2498 BC\nMastabat al-Fir'aun\n\n\n\nThampthis(Existence disputed)\n\n\nc. 2500 BC\n\n\n\nSummary of Listed Kings[edit]\nSneferu[edit]\nMain article: Sneferu\nStatue of Sneferu, Cairo MuseumThe Red Pyramid of Sneferu, Dahshur, Egypt's first \"true\" smooth-sided pyramid\nSneferu, lauded as \"Bringer of Beauty\", \"Master of All Justice\", and \"Ruler of Lower and Upper Nile\", was the first pharaoh of the fourth dynasty. He descended from a family in Middle Egypt that lived near the city of Hermopolis, and most likely ascended to the throne by marrying a royal heiress. There is still debate as to who his father was, with the credit often being given to Huni, but this cannot be confirmed due to the break in dynasties. His mother, Meresankh I was either a lesser wife or concubine of Huni.\nUntil his reign, Egyptian kings were thought to be worldly incarnations of Horus, obtaining total deification exclusively in death. Sneferu was the first king to proclaim that he was the embodiment of Ra, a sun deity.\nSneferu built the Bent Pyramid, imitating King Djoser's tomb, approximately 150 years later.[4] The Red Pyramid is considered to be the first of the \"true\" pyramids built by Sneferu and earned the name due to its red coloration from the limestone used. Sneferu is attributed to constructing the Meidum pyramid, likely for the last king of the Third Dynasty, Huni.\nSneferu may also be responsible for a series of pyramids built in Selia, though no evidence dictates exactly who built them. He did commission a total of three pyramids during his reign.\nMany of Snerferu's political expeditions were to other countries to secure two things: a substantial labor force, through slavery, and access to a large store of building materials. He frequently traveled to Nubia, and Libya for these. The excursions into Nubia, and Libya allowed an extensive labor force to accumulate requiring vast amounts of food sources in order to maintain.\n\nKhufu[edit]\nMain article: Khufu\nStatue of Khufu/Cheops, Cairo Museum.\nKhufu, known to the Greek as Cheops, and Sneferu's successor—though it is unclear whether he was the biological son of Sneferu—was a widely known king. He is still known very well in present-day media, being featured in movies, novels, and television shows. His fame stems from his pyramid on the northeastern plateau at Giza, where he was buried. His mortuary temple was built on the northern end of the pyramid, which is no longer accessible due to grave robbers ravaging the area.\nOnly three-dimensional reliefs have been recovered and have lasted into modern day, including many limestone busts and clay figurines. Khufu's activities in and out of Egypt are not well documented, with the exception of his architecture. The Ancient Greeks remain some of the only texts referencing Khufu, through which they viewed him as a cruel and wicked man who offended the deities and forced his subjects into slavery.[5]\nKhufu, as the son of Sneferu, was believed to be illegitimate and therefore unworthy of the throne. Even if he was Sneferu's true son. He did very little to expand the country of Egypt and failed to follow his father's footsteps of territorial gains.\n\n\n\n\nKing Khufu built The Great Pyramid of Giza\n\n\n\nPrincess Nefertiabet, likely sister of Khufu, from her Giza tomb. Dated ca. 2580 BC. Louvre Museum E 15591\n\n\n\nPainted limestone Sphinx of Hetepheres II, a daughter of Khufu, possibly the first depiction of a sphinx\n\n\nDjedefre[edit]\nMain article: Djedefre\nBust of Djedefre, taken from a sphinx statue\nDjedefre is credited by historians with a reign of eight years. Not much is known of Djedefre, including his inconclusive lineage. It is possible that he is Khufu's son or that he was Khufu's brother. It is widely suggested that he is the son of a lesser queen who murdered the rightful heir to the throne and Djedefre's half brother, the crown prince Kawab.\nDjedefre chose to build his pyramid several kilometers north of Giza, creating speculation that there was a family feud that caused him to want to be far away from Khufu's tomb. A more favorable conclusion was that Djedefre chose to be buried closer to Iunu, the center of the cult of Ra.\nHis pyramid also features a statue of his wife, Hetepheres II, in the form of a sphinx. She was a daughter of Khufu and had been the wife of Kawab. It is sometimes suggested that this was the first true sphinx, although there is debate about the sphinx at Giza that was credited to Khafre. She became the longest living royal member of the dynasty, living into the reign of Shepseskaf.\n\nKhafre[edit]\nMain article: Khafre\nKhafre depicted with Horus\nKhafre, son of Khufu, succeeded his supposed brother, Djedefre, after his short reign. He chose to build his pyramid close to his father, matching it in style and being almost as large. At the front of the pyramid causeway lies the Great Sphinx that is said to bear his features. There is still debate on whether his Sphinx was erected before Djedefre's.[6] Khafre's sphinx was well-known and closer to his subjects, making it harder to determine which was built first due to biased record keeping.\nKhafre built the most amount of statues for Dynasty IV, leading to greater evidence of his 25 year long rule. He did cause controversy however, with his statue depicting his ties still to the god Horus, rather than Ra.[7]\n\nMenkaure[edit]\nMain article: Menkaure\nMenkaure and Khamerernebty II, his sister-wife\nMenkaure succeeded his father, Khafre, as King of Egypt. Menkaure is consistently depicted in his statuary as being around the personifications of deities, and nomes.\nHis pyramid is the third and smallest of those at Giza pyramid complex and is known as Netjer-er-Menkaure, which translates into \"Menkaure is Divine\". There was a sarcophagus found within the pyramid, that is approximately eight feet in length and three feet in height, made of basalt.\n\nShepseskaf[edit]\nMain article: Shepseskaf\nShepseskaf is generally accepted as the last king of the Fourth Dynasty, succeeding Menkaure. There is no conclusive evidence of who his mother is, though it is believed that he was the son of a minor queen. Who his wife was also is unknown.It is also uncertain of his relationship to Menkaure, and if he was a son or brother.\nShepseskaf broke the chain of pyramid building by the previous five kings. Instead of a pyramid, he chose to construct a mastaba, a rectangular block, which is commonly referred to as the Mastabat al-Fir’aun (\"Pharaoh's Bench\").[8]\n\nOther notable individuals[edit]\nBaka[edit]\nThe identification of Baka is unresolved.[9] Several ancient lists of kings have survived. They do not agree, however, and none of them may be considered complete. The Turin King List has a lacuna between Khafre and Menkaure, where the author had listed a king who reigned between these two pharaohs. The name of the king and length of the reign are completely lost in the lacuna.[10]\nThe Saqqara Tablet also notes a king between Khafre and Menkaure, but here too, the name is lost.[11]\nSome authorities have equated this king with Bikheris, on Manetho's list, who could correspond to the Egyptian name Baka or Bakare.\n\nKhentkaus I[edit]\nPerhaps the most intriguing evidence of the fourth dynasty is the status of Khentkaus I, also known as Khentykawes. She was a daughter of Menkaure and her tomb was built along the Menkaure causeway. She may have ruled as king.\nHer tomb is a large mastaba tomb, with another off-center mastaba placed above it. The second mastaba could not be centered over her primary mastaba because of the free, unsupported, space in the rooms below.\nOn a granite doorway leading into her tomb, Khentkaus I is given titles that may be read either as mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt, as mother of the king of upper and lower Egypt and king of upper and lower Egypt, or, as one scholar reads it, king of upper and lower Egypt and mother of two kings of upper and lower Egypt.\nFurthermore, her depiction on this doorway also gives her the full trappings of kingship, including the false beard of the king. This depiction and the title given have led some Egyptologists to suggest that she reigned as king near the end of the fourth dynasty.\nHer tomb was finished in a characteristic niche style of architecture, however, the niches were later filled in with a smooth casing of limestone.\n\nChanges During the Fourth Dynasty[edit]\nAuthority of Kings[edit]\nOn the whole, Egypt was ruled by two centers of power—legal authority and traditional authority. Legal authority constituted governing by the king, not over the people directly, but via viziers and nomarchs. Traditional authority was derived from the concept that the deities gave a king the divine right to rule as he pleased. At its heart, the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian government became organized so that only the king could direct traditional authority.\n\nReligious changes[edit]\nStatue of Ranofer, High Priest of Ptah. End of Fourth, beginning of Fifth Dynasty, circa 2500 BC. Egyptian Museum, Cairo\nThe Fourth Dynasty is a period in which a shift in religious practices can be seen. Worship of the sun was becoming the common practice, as the Cult of Ra grew in size. The worship of the Sun was centered around the tomb of the king, Djedefre in the city Heliopolis,which had been occupied since predynastic times, and named by the Ancient Greeks.[12]\nDuring the era centralization of the nation's resources, material, organic, and human, began to develop a relationship to the king. The kings and their relation to the deities became unchallenged, with the kings carving their named into statues and monuments that had been previously reserved for deities. Khafre's famous statue, where a falcon was incorporated into his headgear, equated the king to the god Horus.\nKings no longer associated pyramids with the afterlife. The afterlife was once believed to be a divine kingdom that was represented as a type of idealistic heaven where only kings and pure hearts could go. Instead, the Fourth Dynasty represented a change in this idea, formulated the notion that the afterlife was a familiar place, taking the semblance of Earth.[13]\n\nChanging customs drove architectural changes[edit]\nRelief of Nofer and his Wife, detail. From Giza, tomb G2110, Dynasty 4, 2575–2465 BC.\nThe Old Kingdom saw a rise in the preservation of the deceased, making the preparation of bodies much more complex. The position of embalmer was created, and their jobs were solely to prepare a corpse in private. There were three ways to mummify a body: 1) Stucco: the body would be wrapped in fine linen and then covered in stucco plaster, the features of the body (including the face) were remodeled in the plaster;[14] 2) Linen: the body would be wrapped in linen, which was sometimes treated with natron (a mixture of multiple sodium carbonates[15]) and the linens would be treated with resin so that the features of the body could be modeled; and 3) Defleshing: removing all flesh and wrapping the bones in linens.[16] Generally, organs were removed which were then put into jars that would accompany the body in the tomb, and the inside of the body flushed out.\nTombs in the Fourth Dynasty changed drastically. \"Unimpressive\" graves did not satisfy the elites, meaning they would settle for smaller structures if the interior was decorated. Hieroglyphic writings were important to elites because, one, it was a lavish display of wealth and, two, it guided their souls to the afterlife. The Fourth Dynasty, however, did not have these writings. Instead, the tomb was deeper and super-structures were larger. After the Giza pyramid complex, later generations of tombs were more reasonably sized. After the Middle Kingdom, royals abandoned pyramids; they preferred graves that were carved into living rock of the Upper Egyptian mountains.\n\nAge of the Pyramids[edit]\nThe Age of the Pyramids refers to the fact that the Fourth Dynasty was the time when most of the well-known pyramids were built, which include those at Giza. King Sneferu was the first king to express an interest in funerary rites and tombs, which led him to the planning of the largest pyramid at Egypt. His first pyramids were called the Bent Pyramid and Red Pyramid. The \"Age of the Pyramids\" was not just about the building of large and easily recognizable structures, but also a change in funerary practices and rituals. This includes the burying of elites in large structures and the use of extensive mummification.\n\n Giza pyramid complex pyramids. From left to right: the Pyramid of Menkaure, Pyramid of Khafre, the Great Sphinx of Giza and Khufu's Great Pyramid of Giza\nComparison of regnal lists[edit]\nThe ancient king lists are in broad agreement on the order of most kings in this dynasty, though the obscure kings known Bikheris and Thamphthis were sometimes excluded. The Saqqara Tablet and Turin King List are both in fragmentary condition for this dynasty and some names and reign lengths have been lost as a result. The Saqqara Tablet has five missing cartouches between Khafre and Userkaf, the founder of the Fifth Dynasty. While up to four of these could be attributed to pharaohs recorded on other lists, it is unknown whose name would have appeared in the fifth cartouche, although Khentkaus I is a possibility.\nManetho's Aegyptiaca had a different order of kings for this dynasty: Sneferu, Khufu, Khafre, Menkaure, Djedefre, Bikheris, Shepseskaf and Thamphthis. This order places the reigns of the three pharaohs buried in the Giza pyramid complex next to each other, and all three kings are recorded reigning for over 60 years each.\n\n\n\nHistorical Pharaoh\n\nAbydos King List\n\nSaqqara Tablet\n\nTurin King List[17]\n\nManetho[18]\n\nReign Years\n\n\nTurin List[17]\n\nManetho[18]\n\n\nSneferu\n\nSneferu\n\nSneferu\n\nSnefer[u]\n\nSoris\n\n24\n\n29\n\n\nKhufu\n\nKhufu\n\nKhufu\n\nName lost\n\nSouphis\n\n23\n\n63\n\n\nDjedefre\n\nDjedefre\n\nDjedefre\n\nName lost\n\nRhatoises\n\n8\n\n25\n\n\nKhafre\n\nKhafre\n\nKhafre\n\nKha[fre]\n\nSouphis\n\nLost\n\n66\n\n\nBikheris\n\n–\n\nName lost\n\nName lost\n\nBikheres\n\nLost\n\n22\n\n\nMenkaure\n\nMenkaure\n\nName lost\n\nName lost\n\nMesochris\n\n28\n\n63\n\n\nShepseskaf\n\nShepseskaf\n\nName lost\n\nName lost\n\nSeberkheres\n\n4\n\n7\n\n\nThamphthis\n\n–\n\nName lost\n\n–\n\nThamphthis\n\n2\n\n9\n\nThird/Fourth dynasty genetics[edit]\nMain article: Old Kingdom individual (NUE001)\nFacial reconstruction and depiction created from the Nuwayrat individual skull.[19]\nNaturalistic contemporary rendering of Princess Nefertiabet, likely daughter of Sneferu and sister of king Khufu, ca. 2580 BCE.[20]\nFor the first time, in a 2025 publication by the scientific journal Nature, a whole-genome genetic study was able to give insights into the genetic background of Old Kingdom individuals, by sequencing the whole genome of an Old Kingdom adult male Egyptian of relatively high-status, radiocarbon-dated to 2855–2570 BCE, with funerary practices archeologically attributed to the Third and Fourth Dynasty, which was excavated in Nuwayrat (Nuerat, نويرات), in a cliff 265 km south of Cairo.[21][22] Before this study, whole-genome sequencing of ancient Egyptians from the early periods of Egyptian Dynastic history had not yet been accomplished, mainly because of the problematic DNA preservation conditions in Egypt.[21]\n\nAncestry model of Egyptian genome from Nuwayrat.[21]\nThe corpse had been placed intact in a large circular clay pot without embalming, and then installed inside a cliff tomb, which accounts for the comparatively good level of conservation of the skeleton and its DNA.[21] Most of his genome was found to be associated with North African Neolithic ancestry, but about 20% of his genetic ancestry could be sourced to the eastern Fertile Crescent, including Mesopotamia.[21] The genetic profile was most closely represented by a two-source model, in which 77.6% ± 3.8% of the ancestry corresponded to genomes from the Middle Neolithic Moroccan site of Skhirat-Rouazi (dated to 4780–4230 BCE), which itself consists of predominantly (76.4 ± 4.0%) Levant Neolithic ancestry and (23.6 ± 4.0%) minor Iberomaurusian ancestry, while the remainder (22.4% ± 3.8%) was most closely related to known genomes from Neolithic Mesopotamia (dated to 9000-8000 BCE).[21][23] Genomes from the Neolithic/Chalcolithic Levant only appeared as a minor third-place component in three-source models.[21] A 2022 DNA study had already shown evidence of gene flow from the Mesopotamian and Zagros regions into surrounding areas, including Anatolia, during the Neolithic, but not as far as Egypt yet.[23]\nIn terms of chronology, Egypt was one of the first areas to adopt the Neolithic package emerging from West Asia as early as the 6th millennium BCE.[21] Population genetics in the Nile Valley observed a marked change around this period, as shown by odontometric and dental tissue changes.[21] Cultural exchange and trade between the two regions then continued through the 4th millennium BCE, as shown by the transfer of Mesopotamian Late Uruk period features to the Nile Valley of the later Predynastic Period.[21] Migrations flows from Mesopotamia accompanied such cultural exchanges, possibly through the sea routes of the Mediterranean and the Red Sea or through yet un-sampled intermediaries in the Levant, which could explain the relative smallness of genetic influence from known Chalcolithic/Bronze Age Levantines populations.[21]\nOverall, the 2025 study \"provides direct evidence of genetic ancestry related to the eastern Fertile Crescent in ancient Egypt\".[21] This genetic connection suggests that there had been ancient migration flows from the eastern Fertile Crescent to Egypt, in addition to the exchanges of objects and imagery (domesticated animals and plants, writing systems...) already observed.[21] This suggests a pattern of wide cultural and demographic expansion from the Mesopotamian region, which affected both Anatolia and Egypt during this period.[21]\n\nFourth Dynasty timeline[edit]\n\n\n\n\nWikimedia Commons has media related to 4th dynasty of Egypt.\n\nSee also[edit]\nEgyptian Fourth Dynasty Family Tree\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ Shaw, Ian, ed.

Secure Shell mitigates this risk through the use of encryption mechanisms that are intended to hide the contents of the transmission from an observer, even if the observer has access to the entire data stream.[2]\nFinnish computer scientist Tatu Ylönen designed SSH in 1995 and provided an implementation in the form of two commands, ssh and slogin, as secure replacements for rsh and rlogin, respectively. Subsequent development of the protocol suite proceeded in several developer groups, producing several variants of implementation. The protocol specification distinguishes two major versions, referred to as SSH-1 and SSH-2. The most commonly implemented software stack is OpenSSH, released in 1999 as open-source software by the OpenBSD developers. Implementations are distributed for all types of operating systems in common use, including embedded systems.\nSSH applications are based on a client–server architecture, connecting an SSH client instance with an SSH server.[3] SSH operates as a layered protocol suite comprising three principal hierarchical components: the transport layer provides server authentication, confidentiality, and integrity; the user authentication protocol validates the user to the server; and the connection protocol multiplexes the encrypted tunnel into multiple logical communication channels.[1]\n\n\nDefinition[edit]\nSSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the remote computer and allow it to authenticate the user, if necessary.[3]\nSSH may be used in several methodologies. In the simplest manner, both ends of a communication channel use automatically generated public-private key pairs to encrypt a network connection, and then use a password to authenticate the user.\nWhen the public-private key pair is generated by the user manually, the authentication is essentially performed when the key pair is created, and a session may then be opened automatically without a password prompt. In this scenario, the public key is placed on all computers that must allow access to the owner of the matching private key, which the owner keeps private. While authentication is based on the private key, the key is never transferred through the network during authentication. SSH only verifies that the same person offering the public key also owns the matching private key.\nIn all versions of SSH it is important to verify unknown public keys, i.e. associate the public keys with identities, before accepting them as valid. Accepting an attacker's public key without validation will authorize an unauthorized attacker as a valid user.\n\nAuthentication: OpenSSH key management[edit]\nOn Unix-like systems, the list of authorized public keys is typically stored in the home directory of the user that is allowed to log in remotely, in the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.[4] This file is respected by SSH only if it is not writable by anything apart from the owner and root. When the public key is present on the remote end and the matching private key is present on the local end, typing in the password is no longer required. However, for additional security the private key itself can be locked with a passphrase.\nThe private key can also be looked for in standard places, and its full path can be specified as a command line setting (the option -i for ssh). The ssh-keygen utility produces the public and private keys, always in pairs.\n\nUse[edit]\nThis section possibly contains original research.

(June 2024) (Learn how and when to remove this message)\nSSH is typically used to log into a remote computer's shell or command-line interface (CLI) and to execute commands on a remote server. It also supports mechanisms for tunneling, forwarding of TCP ports and X11 connections and it can be used to transfer files using the associated SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or Secure Copy Protocol (SCP).[3]\nSSH uses the client–server model. An SSH client program is typically used for establishing connections to an SSH daemon, such as sshd, accepting remote connections. Both are commonly present on most modern operating systems, including macOS, most distributions of Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris and OpenVMS. Notably, versions of Windows prior to Windows 10 version 1709 do not include SSH by default, but proprietary, freeware and open source versions of various levels of complexity and completeness did and do exist (see Comparison of SSH clients). In 2018 Microsoft began porting the OpenSSH source code to Windows[5] and in Windows 10 version 1709, an official Win32 port of OpenSSH is now available.\nFile managers for UNIX-like systems (e.g. Konqueror) can use the FISH protocol to provide a split-pane GUI with drag-and-drop.  The open source Windows program WinSCP[6] provides similar file management (synchronization, copy, remote delete) capability using PuTTY as a back-end.  Both WinSCP[7] and PuTTY[8] are available packaged to run directly off a USB drive, without requiring installation on the client machine. Crostini on ChromeOS comes with OpenSSH by default. Setting up an SSH server in Windows typically involves enabling a feature in the Settings app.\nSSH is important in cloud computing to solve connectivity problems, avoiding the security issues of exposing a cloud-based virtual machine directly on the Internet. An SSH tunnel can provide a secure path over the Internet, through a firewall to a virtual machine.[9]\nThe IANA has assigned TCP port 22, UDP port 22 and SCTP port 22 for this protocol.[10] IANA had listed the standard TCP port 22 for SSH servers as one of the well-known ports as early as 2001.[11] SSH can also be run using SCTP rather than TCP as the connection oriented transport layer protocol.[12]\n\nHistorical development[edit]\nVersion 1[edit]\nIn 1995, Tatu Ylönen, a researcher at Helsinki University of Technology in Finland designed the first version of the protocol (now called SSH-1) prompted by a password-sniffing attack at his university network.[13] The goal of SSH was to replace the earlier rlogin, TELNET, FTP[14] and rsh protocols, which did not provide strong authentication nor guarantee confidentiality. He chose the port number 22 because it is between telnet (port 23) and ftp (port 21).[15]\nYlönen released his implementation as freeware in July 1995, and the tool quickly gained in popularity. Towards the end of 1995, the SSH user base had grown to 20,000 users in fifty countries.[16]\nIn December 1995, Ylönen founded SSH Communications Security to market and develop SSH. The original version of the SSH software used various pieces of free software, such as GNU libgmp, but later versions released by SSH Communications Security evolved into increasingly proprietary software.\nIt was estimated that by 2000 the number of users had grown to 2 million.[17]\n\nVersion 2[edit]\nIn 2006, after being discussed in a working group named \"secsh\",[18] a revised version of the SSH protocol, SSH-2 was adopted as a standard.[19] This version offers improved security and new features, but is not compatible with SSH-1. For example, it introduces new key-exchange mechanisms like Diffie–Hellman key exchange, improved data integrity checking via message authentication codes like MD5 or SHA-1, which can be negotiated between client and server. SSH-2 also adds stronger encryption methods like AES which eventually replaced weaker and compromised ciphers from the previous standard like 3DES.[20][21][19] New features of SSH-2 include the ability to run any number of shell sessions over a single SSH connection.[22] Due to SSH-2's superiority and popularity over SSH-1, some implementations such as libssh (v0.8.0+),[23] Lsh[24] and Dropbear[25] eventually supported only the SSH-2 protocol.\n\nVersion 1.99[edit]\nIn January 2006, well after version 2.1 was established, RFC 4253 specified that an SSH server supporting 2.0 as well as prior versions should identify its protocol version as 1.99.[26] This version number does not reflect a historical software revision, but a method to identify backward compatibility.\n\nOSSH and OpenSSH[edit]\nIn 1999, developers, desiring availability of a free software version, restarted software development from the 1.2.12 release of the original SSH program, which was the last released under an open source license.[27] This served as a code base for Björn Grönvall's OSSH software.[28] Shortly thereafter, OpenBSD developers forked Grönvall's code and created OpenSSH, which shipped with Release 2.6 of OpenBSD. From this version, a \"portability\" branch was formed to port OpenSSH to other operating systems.[29]\nAs of 2005[update], OpenSSH was the single most popular SSH implementation, being the default version in a large number of operating system distributions. OSSH meanwhile has become obsolete.[30] OpenSSH continues to be maintained and supports the SSH-2 protocol, having expunged SSH-1 support from the codebase in the OpenSSH 7.6 release.\n\nFuture[edit]\nIn 2023, an alternative to traditional SSH was proposed under the name SSH3[31][32][33] by PhD student François Michel and Professor Olivier Bonaventure and its code has been made open source.[34] This new version implements the original SSH Connection Protocol but operates on top of HTTP/3, which runs on QUIC. It offers multiple features such as:\n\nFaster session establishment, reducing the number of Round-trip delays from 5-7 to 3.\nHigh security: while SSHv2 relies on its own protocols, SSH3 leverages TLS 1.3, QUIC, and HTTP.\nUDP port forwarding\nX.509 certificates\nOpenID Connect\nHowever, the name SSH3 is under discussion, and the project aims to rename itself to a more suitable name.[35] The discussion stems from the fact that this new implementation significantly revises the SSH protocol, suggesting it should not be called SSH3.\n\nUses[edit]\nExample of tunneling an X11 application over SSH: the user 'josh' has \"SSHed\" from the local machine 'foofighter' to the remote machine 'tengwar' to run xeyes.\nLogging into OpenWrt via SSH using PuTTY running on Windows.\nSSH is a protocol that can be used for many applications across many platforms including most Unix variants (Linux, the BSDs including Apple's macOS, and Solaris), as well as Microsoft Windows. Some of the applications below may require features that are only available or compatible with specific SSH clients or servers. For example, using the SSH protocol to implement a VPN is possible, but presently only with the OpenSSH server and client implementation.\n\nFor login to a shell on a remote host (replacing Telnet and rlogin)\nFor executing a single command on a remote host (replacing rsh)\nFor setting up automatic (passwordless) login to a remote server (for example, using OpenSSH[36])\nIn combination with rsync to back up, copy and mirror files efficiently and securely\nFor forwarding a port\nFor tunneling (not to be confused with a VPN, which routes packets between different networks, or bridges two broadcast domains into one).\nFor using as a full-fledged encrypted VPN. Note that only OpenSSH server and client supports this feature.\nFor forwarding X from a remote host (possible through multiple intermediate hosts)\nFor browsing the web through an encrypted proxy connection with SSH clients that support the SOCKS protocol.\nFor securely mounting a directory on a remote server as a file system on a local computer using SSHFS.\nFor automated remote monitoring and management of servers through one or more of the mechanisms discussed above.\nFor development on a mobile or embedded device that supports SSH.\nFor securing file transfer protocols.\nFile transfer protocols[edit]\nThe Secure Shell protocols are used in several file transfer mechanisms.\n\nSecure copy (SCP), which evolved from RCP protocol over SSH\nrsync, intended to be more efficient than SCP. Generally runs over an SSH connection.\nSSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), a secure alternative to FTP (not to be confused with FTP over SSH or FTPS)\nFiles transferred over shell protocol (FISH), released in 1998, which evolved from Unix shell commands over SSH\nFast and Secure Protocol (FASP), aka Aspera, uses SSH for control and UDP ports for data transfer.\nArchitecture[edit]\nDiagram of the SSH-2 binary packet.\nThe SSH protocol has a layered architecture with three separate components:\n\nThe transport layer (RFC 4253) typically uses the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) of TCP/IP, reserving port number 22 as a server listening port. This layer handles initial key exchange as well as server authentication, and sets up encryption, compression, and integrity verification. It exposes to the upper layer an interface for sending and receiving plaintext packets with a size of up to 32,768 bytes each, but more can be allowed by each implementation. The transport layer also arranges for key re-exchange, usually after 1 GB of data has been transferred or after one hour has passed, whichever occurs first.\nThe user authentication layer (RFC 4252) handles client authentication, and provides a suite of authentication algorithms. Authentication is client-driven: when one is prompted for a password, it may be the SSH client prompting, not the server. The server merely responds to the client's authentication requests. Widely used user-authentication methods include the following:\npassword: a method for straightforward password authentication, including a facility allowing a password to be changed. Not all programs implement this method.\npublickey: a method for public-key-based authentication, usually supporting at least DSA, ECDSA or RSA keypairs, with other implementations also supporting X.509 certificates.\nkeyboard-interactive (RFC 4256): a versatile method where the server sends one or more prompts to enter information and the client displays them and sends back responses keyed-in by the user. Used to provide one-time password authentication such as S/Key or SecurID. Used by some OpenSSH configurations when PAM is the underlying host-authentication provider to effectively provide password authentication, sometimes leading to inability to log in with a client that supports just the plain password authentication method.\nGSSAPI authentication methods which provide an extensible scheme to perform SSH authentication using external mechanisms such as Kerberos 5 or NTLM, providing single sign-on capability to SSH sessions. These methods are usually implemented by commercial SSH implementations for use in organizations, though OpenSSH does have a working GSSAPI implementation.\nThe connection layer (RFC 4254) defines the concept of channels, channel requests, and global requests, which define the SSH services provided. A single SSH connection can be multiplexed into multiple logical channels simultaneously, each transferring data bidirectionally. Channel requests are used to relay out-of-band channel-specific data, such as the changed size of a terminal window, or the exit code of a server-side process. Additionally, each channel performs its own flow control using the receive window size. The SSH client requests a server-side port to be forwarded using a global request. Standard channel types include:\nshell for terminal shells, SFTP and exec requests (including SCP transfers)\ndirect-tcpip for client-to-server forwarded connections\nforwarded-tcpip for server-to-client forwarded connections\nThe SSHFP DNS record (RFC 4255) provides the public host key fingerprints in order to aid in verifying the authenticity of the host.\nThis open architecture provides considerable flexibility, allowing the use of SSH for a variety of purposes beyond a secure shell. The functionality of the transport layer alone is comparable to Transport Layer Security (TLS); the user-authentication layer is highly extensible with custom authentication methods; and the connection layer provides the ability to multiplex many secondary sessions into a single SSH connection, a feature comparable to BEEP and not available in TLS.\n\nAlgorithms[edit]\nEdDSA,[37] ECDSA, RSA and DSA for public-key cryptography.[38]\nECDH and Diffie–Hellman for key exchange.[38]\nHMAC, AEAD and UMAC for MAC.[39]\nAES (and deprecated RC4, 3DES, DES[40]) for symmetric encryption.\nAES-GCM[41] and ChaCha20-Poly1305 for AEAD encryption.\nSHA (and deprecated MD5) for key fingerprint.\nVulnerabilities[edit]\nSSH-1[edit]\nIn 1998, a vulnerability was described in SSH 1.5 which allowed the unauthorized insertion of content into an encrypted SSH stream due to insufficient data integrity protection from CRC-32 used in this version of the protocol.[42][43] A fix known as SSH Compensation Attack Detector[44] was introduced into most implementations. Many of these updated implementations contained a new integer overflow vulnerability[45] that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the SSH daemon, typically root.\nIn January 2001 a vulnerability was discovered that allows attackers to modify the last block of an IDEA-encrypted session.[46] The same month, another vulnerability was discovered that allowed a malicious server to forward a client authentication to another server.[47]\nSince SSH-1 has inherent design flaws which make it vulnerable, it is now generally considered obsolete and should be avoided by explicitly disabling fallback to SSH-1.  Most modern servers and clients support SSH-2.[47]\n\nCBC plaintext recovery[edit]\nIn November 2008, a theoretical vulnerability was discovered for all versions of SSH which allowed recovery of up to 32 bits of plaintext from a block of ciphertext that was encrypted using what was then the standard default encryption mode, CBC.[48] The most straightforward solution is to use CTR, counter mode, instead of CBC mode, since this renders SSH resistant to the attack.[48]\n\nSuspected decryption by NSA[edit]\nOn December 28, 2014 Der Spiegel published classified information[49] leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden which suggests that the National Security Agency may be able to decrypt some SSH traffic. The technical details associated with such a process were not disclosed. A 2017 analysis of the CIA hacking tools BothanSpy and Gyrfalcon suggested that the SSH protocol was not compromised.[50]\n\nTerrapin attack[edit]\nMain article: Terrapin attack\nA novel man-in-the-middle attack against most current ssh implementations was discovered in 2023. It was named the Terrapin attack by its discoverers.[51][52] However, the risk is mitigated by the requirement to intercept a genuine ssh session, and that the attack is restricted in its scope, fortuitously resulting mostly in failed connections.[53][54] The ssh developers have stated that the major impact of the attack is to degrade the keystroke timing obfuscation features of ssh.[54] The vulnerability was fixed in OpenSSH 9.6, but requires both client and server to be upgraded for the fix to be fully effective.\n\nStandards documentation[edit]\nThe following RFC publications by the IETF \"secsh\" working group document SSH-2 as a proposed Internet standard.\n\nRFC 4250 – The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Assigned Numbers\nRFC 4251 – The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol Architecture\nRFC 4252 – The Secure Shell (SSH) Authentication Protocol\nRFC 4253 – The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol\nRFC 4254 – The Secure Shell (SSH) Connection Protocol\nRFC 4255 – Using DNS to Securely Publish Secure Shell (SSH) Key Fingerprints\nRFC 4256 – Generic Message Exchange Authentication for the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH)\nRFC 4335 – The Secure Shell (SSH) Session Channel Break Extension\nRFC 4344 – The Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Encryption Modes\nRFC 4345 – Improved Arcfour Modes for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol\nThe protocol specifications were later updated by the following publications:\n\nRFC 4419 – Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol (March 2006)\nRFC 4432 – RSA Key Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol (March 2006)\nRFC 4462 – Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API) Authentication and Key Exchange for the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol (May 2006)\nRFC 4716 – The Secure Shell (SSH) Public Key File Format (November 2006)\nRFC 4819 – Secure Shell Public Key Subsystem (March 2007)\nRFC 5647 – AES Galois Counter Mode for the Secure Shell Transport Layer Protocol (August 2009)\nRFC 5656 – Elliptic Curve Algorithm Integration in the Secure Shell Transport Layer (December 2009)\nRFC 6187 – X.509v3 Certificates for Secure Shell Authentication (March 2011)\nRFC 6239 – Suite B Cryptographic Suites for Secure Shell (SSH) (May 2011)\nRFC 6594 – Use of the SHA-256 Algorithm with RSA, Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and Elliptic Curve DSA (ECDSA) in SSHFP Resource Records (April 2012)\nRFC 6668 – SHA-2 Data Integrity Verification for the Secure Shell (SSH) Transport Layer Protocol (July 2012)\nRFC 7479 – Ed25519 SSHFP Resource Records (March 2015)\nRFC 5592 – Secure Shell Transport Model for the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) (June 2009)\nRFC 6242 – Using the NETCONF Protocol over Secure Shell (SSH) (June 2011)\nRFC 8332 – Use of RSA Keys with SHA-256 and SHA-512 in the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol (March 2018)\nRFC 8709 – Ed25519 and Ed448 Public Key Algorithms for the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol (February 2020)\ndraft-gerhards-syslog-transport-ssh – SSH transport mapping for SYSLOG (July 2006)\ndraft-ietf-secsh-filexfer – SSH File Transfer Protocol (July 2006)\ndraft-ietf-sshm-ssh-agent - SSH Agent Protocol (March 2025)\nIn addition, the OpenSSH project includes several vendor protocol specifications/extensions:\n\nOpenSSH PROTOCOL overview\nOpenSSH certificate/key overview\nOpenSSH FIDO/u2f support\nSee also[edit]\nBrute-force attack\nComparison of SSH clients\nComparison of SSH servers\nCorkscrew\nIdent\nOpenSSH\nSecure Shell tunneling\nWeb-based SSH\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b T.

P. J. Abdul Kalam\nPersonal detailsBorn (1960-11-24) 24 November 1960 (age 64)Amravati, Maharashtra, IndiaParentR. S. Gavai (father)\nBhushan Ramkrishna Gavai (born 24 November 1960) is an Indian jurist who is currently serving as the 52nd Chief Justice of India since 14 May 2025.[1] He is a former judge of the Bombay High Court and also currently serves as the chancellor of some National Law Universities (NLUs). He is the second ever Chief Justice of India to be belonging to Scheduled Caste. [2][3][4] He is also the ex officio patron-in-chief of National Legal Services Authority.[5]\n\n\nEarly life and education[edit]\nGavai was born on 24 November 1960 in Amravati, Maharashtra, and studied at a primary municipal school in Amravati. He then studied at Chikitsak Samuha Shirolkar Madhyamik Shala and at Holy Name High School in Mumbai.[6] After earning degrees in commerce and in law from Amravati University, he joined the legal profession in 1985.[7]\n\nCareer[edit]\n President Droupadi Murmu administering the oath of office to Justice BR Gavai as the Chief Justice of India on 14 May 2025.\nGavai worked with Bar under Raja S. Bhonsale, former advocate general and judge of the High Court. He practiced independently at Bombay High Court from 1987 to 1990. After 1990, he practiced mainly before the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court. He also practiced constitutional law and administrative law.[1]\nGavai was standing counsel for the municipal corporation of Nagpur, Amravati Municipal Corporation, and Amravati University. He regularly represented as counsel various autonomous bodies and corporations like SICOM, DCVL, etc., and various municipal councils in the Vidarbha region. He was appointed as assistant government pleader and additional public prosecutor in the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, Nagpur Bench, from August 1992 to July 1993. Later, he was appointed as government pleader and public prosecutor for the Nagpur Bench on 17 January 2000. He was elevated as an additional judge of the High Court on 14 November 2003. On 12 November 2005, he became a permanent judge of the Bombay High Court. After serving as a High Court judge for 14 years, he was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court of India on 24 May 2019, a position he held until 13 May 2025.[8]\nOn 14 May 2025, Justice Bhushan Ramakrishna Gavai was sworn in as the 52nd Chief Justice of India by President Droupadi Murmu. His term will be till 23 November 2025 i.e. for six months. He is the first Chief Justice of India from the Buddhist community. He is also the second Dalit (SC) to hold the office, following Justice K. G. Balakrishnan, a member of the Scheduled Castes, who previously served as Chief Justice.[9][10][11][12] As of January 2025, the Supreme Court of India had three sitting judges from the Scheduled Castes – Justice B. R. Gavai, Justice C. T. Ravikumar (since retired), and Justice Prasanna Varale. This marks the highest representation of the Scheduled Caste community in the history of the Supreme Court.[9][10][11][12] Notably, both Justice B. R. Gavai and Justice Prasanna B. Varale belong to the Buddhist faith, making it the first time in the Court's history that two Buddhist judges are serving simultaneously.[9][10][11][12] He is due to retire on 23 November 2025.[1]\n\nNotable judgements[edit]\nJustice B.R. Gavai has authored and contributed to several landmark decisions of the Supreme Court of India. His judgments span a wide range of constitutional, criminal, and administrative matters.\n\nArticle 370 abrogation[edit]\nJustice Gavai was a member of the five-judge Constitution Bench that upheld the abrogation of Article 370, which granted special status to the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir. The Court ruled unanimously that the Presidential orders and the subsequent changes by Parliament were constitutionally valid. The Bench also directed that statehood be restored and that elections be conducted by September 2024.[13]\n\nElectoral bonds scheme struck down[edit]\nIn Association for Democratic Reforms v. Union of India, Justice Gavai was part of the Constitution Bench that unanimously struck down the Electoral Bonds Scheme, holding it to be violative of citizens' right to information under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.[14]\n\nBulldozer demolitions without due process[edit]\nJustice Gavai co-authored a decision that condemned demolition of homes of accused persons by state authorities without following due process. The Court held that such actions violated the principles of the rule of law and separation of powers.[15]\n\nSub-classification among scheduled castes[edit]\nJustice Gavai was part of the seven-judge Constitution Bench in State of Punjab v. Davinder Singh, which held that sub-classification among Scheduled Castes for more equitable affirmative action is permissible. He emphasized the need to identify and exclude the creamy layer within SC/ST categories to ensure substantive equality.[16]\n\nStay on conviction of Rahul Gandhi[edit]\nIn 2023, Justice Gavai was part of the Bench that stayed the conviction of Rahul Gandhi in a criminal defamation case. The Court noted that the conviction had far-reaching consequences, including disqualification from Parliament.[17]\n\nPersonal life[edit]\nBhushan Ramakrishan Gavai was born to R.S. Gavai and Kamala on 24 November 1960. His father led the Republican Party of India (Gavai) faction and had been an M.P. and Governor. His daughter Karishma Gavai works as an assistant professor in National Law University Nagpur. His brother Rajendra Gavai is also a politician. His family is inspired by B. R. Ambedkar and follows Buddhism.[18][19][20][21]\n\nControversies[edit]\nIn September 2025, he created a controversy with his remarks in a case concerning the restoration of an idol of Vishnu at a temple. He told the petitioner, \"Go and ask the deity himself to do something. If you say that you are a strong devotee of Lord Vishnu, then pray and meditate.\" However, he later clarified that he respects all religions.[22][23]\nOn October 6, 2025, advocate Rakesh Kishore attempted to attack him with a shoe over his remarks on Vishnu.[24][25]\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n^ a b c \"Justice Bhushan Ramkrishna Gavai\".

Because Wikipedia aims to summarize significant opinions with representation in proportion to their prominence, a Wikipedia article should not make a fringe theory appear more notable or more widely accepted than it is. Statements about the truth of a theory must be based upon independent reliable sources. If discussed in an article about a mainstream idea, a theory that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight,[1] and reliable sources must be cited that affirm the relationship of the marginal idea to the mainstream idea in a serious and substantial manner.\nThere are numerous reasons for these requirements. Wikipedia is not and must not become the validating source for non-significant subjects, and it is not a forum for original research.[2] For writers and editors of Wikipedia articles to write about controversial ideas in a neutral manner, it is of vital importance that they simply restate what is said by independent secondary sources of reasonable reliability and quality.\nThe governing policies regarding fringe theories are the three core content policies: Neutral point of view, No original research, and Verifiability. Jointly these say that articles should not contain any novel analysis or synthesis, that material likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, and that all majority and significant-minority views published in reliable sources should be represented fairly and proportionately. Should any inconsistency arise between this guideline and the content policies, the policies take precedence.\nFringe theories and related articles have been the subject of several arbitration cases. See Wikipedia:Fringe theories/Arbitration cases.\n\n\nIdentifying fringe theories[edit]\nWe use the term fringe theory in a very broad sense to describe an idea that departs significantly from the prevailing views or mainstream views in its particular field. For example, fringe theories in science depart significantly from mainstream science and have little or no scientific support.[3] Other examples include conspiracy theories and esoteric claims about medicine. Scholarly opinion is generally the most authoritative source to identify the mainstream view. However, there are at least two caveats: not every identified subject matter has its own academic specialization, and the opinion of a scholar whose expertise is in a different field should not be given undue weight.\nWhen discussing topics that reliable sources say are pseudoscientific or fringe theories, editors should be careful not to present the pseudoscientific fringe views alongside the scientific or academic consensus as though they are opposing but still equal views. While pseudoscience may, in some cases, be significant to an article, it should not obfuscate the description or prominence of the mainstream views.\n\n\nSpectrum of fringe theories[edit]\nNot all pseudoscience and fringe theories are alike. In addition, there is an approximate demarcation between pseudoscience and questionable science, and they merit careful treatment.[4] Poorly conducted research, research fraud and other types of bad science are not necessarily pseudoscientific – refer to reliable sources to find the appropriate characterisation.\n\nPseudoscience[edit]\nShortcutWP:FRINGE/PSWP:FRINGE/PS\nProposals that, while purporting to be scientific, are obviously bogus may be so labeled and categorized as such without more justification. For example, since the universal scientific view is that perpetual motion is impossible, any purported perpetual motion mechanism (e.g. Stanley Meyer's water fuel cell) may be treated as pseudoscience. Proposals that are generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community, such as astrology, may properly contain that information and may be categorized as pseudoscience.\n\nY Pseudoscience (Non-scientific statement claiming to be scientific): String theory proves that running water emits electricity when the quarks are aligned with the stars.\nN Not pseudoscience (no claim that it's scientific): Santa Claus has magic reindeer that can fly.\nQuestionable science[edit]\nShortcutWP:FRINGE/QSWP:FRINGE/QS\nArticles about hypotheses that have a substantial following but which critics describe as pseudoscience, may note those critics' views; however, such hypotheses should not be described as unambiguously pseudoscientific if a reasonable amount of academic debate still exists.\n\nAlternative theoretical formulations[edit]\nShortcutWP:FRINGE/ALTWP:FRINGE/ALT\nAlternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community are not pseudoscience, but part of the scientific process. They should not be classified as pseudoscience but should still be put into context with respect to the mainstream perspective. Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality, but, should they succeed in doing so, will usually be rapidly accepted. For instance, continental drift was heavily criticized because there was no known mechanism for continents to move and the proposed mechanisms were implausible. When a mechanism was discovered through plate tectonics, it became mainstream. In other cases, an alternative theoretical formulation lacks significant evidence to show its validity, but when such evidence is produced, the theory can become mainstream. Examples of this are the existence of Troy,[5][6] the Norse colonization of the Americas, and the Big Bang Theory.[7]\nTo determine whether something is pseudoscientific or merely an alternative theoretical formulation, consider this: Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science, or deal with strong, puzzling evidence—which is difficult to explain away—in an effort to create a model that better explains reality. Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in the basic laws of nature to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs, but lack the strong scientific evidence or rigour that would justify such major changes. Pseudoscience usually relies on attacking mainstream scientific theories and methodology while lacking a critical discourse itself (as is common among proponents of creation science), relies on weak evidence such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence (as for example in parapsychology), or indulges a suspect theoretical premise (such as the claims of water memory made by advocates of homeopathy).\n\nSourcing[edit]\nReliable sources[edit]\nSee also: WP:SOURCE and WP:IRS\nReliable sources are needed for any article in Wikipedia. They are needed to demonstrate that an idea is sufficiently notable to merit a dedicated article about it. For a fringe view to be discussed in an article about a mainstream idea, independent reliable sources must discuss the relationship of the two as a serious and substantial matter.\nReliable sources on Wikipedia may include peer-reviewed journals; books published by university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. Academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, but material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas.\nSubjects receive attention in Wikipedia in proportion to the level of detail in the sources from which the article is written. For example, if the only references to a particular subject are in news sources, then a level of detail which is greater than that which appears in these news sources is inappropriate, because Wikipedia policy prohibits original research. The no original research policy strongly encourages the collection and organization of information from existing secondary sources, and allows for careful use of primary sources.\n\nIndependent sources[edit]\nShortcutsWP:FRINDWP:FRINDWP:MSSWP:MSS\nSee also: Wikipedia:Independent sources\nThe best sources to use when describing fringe theories, and in determining their notability and prominence, are reliable sources that are outside the sourcing ecosystem of the fringe theory itself, as such sources are necessary to determine the relationship of a fringe theory to mainstream scholarly discourse. In particular, the relative space that an article devotes to different aspects of a fringe theory should follow from consideration primarily of mainstream secondary sources. Points that are not discussed in these mainstream sources should not be given any space in articles. Fringe sources can be used to support text that describes fringe theories provided that such sources have been noticed and given proper context in mainstream sources.\n\nParity of sources[edit]\nShortcutWP:PARITYWP:PARITY\nInclusion and exclusion of content related to fringe theories and criticism of fringe theories may be done by means of a rough parity of sources. If an article is written about a well-known topic about which many peer-reviewed articles are written, it should not include fringe theories that may seem relevant but are only sourced to obscure texts that lack peer review. Note that fringe journals exist, some of which claim peer review. Only a few of these actually have any meaningful peer review outside of promoters of the fringe theories, and they should generally be considered unreliable. Examples of unreliable journals include but are not limited to: the Creation Research Society Quarterly, Homeopathy, and the Journal of Frontier Science (which uses blog comments[8] as its supposed peer review).\nIn an article on a fringe topic, if a notable fringe theory is primarily described by amateurs and self-published texts, verifiable and reliable criticism of the fringe theory need not be published in a peer-reviewed journal. For example, the Moon landing conspiracy theories article may include material from reliable websites, movies, television specials, and books that are not peer-reviewed. By parity of sources, critiques of that material can likewise be gleaned from reliable websites and books that are not peer-reviewed. Of course, for any viewpoint described in an article, only reliable sources should be used; Wikipedia's verifiability and biographies of living persons policies are not suspended simply because the topic is a fringe theory.\nParity of sources may mean that certain fringe theories are only reliably and verifiably reported on, or criticized, in alternative venues from those that are typically considered reliable sources for scientific topics on Wikipedia. For example, the lack of peer-reviewed criticism of creation science should not be used as a justification for marginalizing or removing scientific criticism of creation science, since creation science itself is not published in peer-reviewed journals. Likewise, the views of adherents should not be excluded from an article on creation science solely on the basis that their work lacks peer review. Other considerations for notability should be considered as well. Fringe views are properly excluded from articles on mainstream subjects to the extent that they are rarely if ever included by reliable sources on those subjects.\nThe prominence of fringe views needs to be put in perspective relative to the views of the entire encompassing field; limiting that relative perspective to a restricted subset of specialists or only among the proponents of that view is, necessarily, biased and unrepresentative.\n\nAttribution[edit]\nMain pages: Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research\nWikipedia is meant to be a tertiary source of information, summarizing the information gleaned from secondary sources, and in some cases from primary sources. Primary sources about research and investigations should only be used to verify the text and should not be relied on exclusively as doing so would violate Wikipedia's policies on original research. In the case of obscure fringe theories, secondary sources that describe the theories should be carefully vetted for reliability.\n\nQuotations[edit]\nWhile proper attribution of a perspective to a source satisfies the minimal requirements of Wikipedia's neutral point of view, there is an additional editorial responsibility for including only those quotes and perspectives which further the aim of creating a verifiable and neutral Wikipedia article. Quotes that are controversial or potentially misleading need to be properly contextualized to avoid unintentional endorsement or deprecation. What is more, just because a quote is accurate and verifiably attributed to a particular source does not mean that the quote must necessarily be included in an article. The sourced contribution must simply aid in the verifiable and neutral presentation of the subject.\nFor example, in the article about Bigfoot, a verifiably attributed and accurately preserved quotation might take the following form:\n\nThe Bigfoot Field Researchers Association has stated, \"Scientists from various disciplines put the most compelling sasquatch evidence to the test. Collectively their conclusions are ground-breaking. There is now scientific proof for the existence of a giant primate species in North America—a species fitting the descriptions of sasquatches (bigfoots).\"\nIncluding such a quote needs to be carefully contextualized as a particular point of view. Simply including such a statement in the lead or in a section on scientific evaluation of Bigfoot claims is potentially misleading, non-neutral, and lacking in verifiability. The quote should only be included if it can be contextualized in a verifiable and neutral sense as a point of view of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Association and not necessarily a factual statement. The consensus of editors may even be to not include the quote at all.\n\nIn-text attribution[edit]\nShortcutWP:ITAWP:ITA\nSee also: In-text attribution and Assert facts, not opinions\nThe careful use of sources is vital when writing about criticism of fringe theories. Since fringe theories may be obscure topics that few non-adherents write about, there may only be a small number of sources that directly dispute them. Care should be taken not to mislead the reader by implying that, because the claim is actively disputed by only a few, it is otherwise supported. Particularly harsh criticism should be attributed—\"Philosopher A. C. Grayling dismisses intelligent design as 'a little driblet of childish ignorance; a mark of mankind's infancy'\"—while simple facts—\"humans and chimpanzees evolved from a common ancestor\"—are best left stated simply as facts rather than recast as opinions. Be careful not to use in-text attribution carelessly to imply that only the named sources would agree. A careful use of words and the adoption of a disinterested tone will ensure that a reader is not spoonfed opinions as facts and vice versa.\n\nCoverage in Wikipedia[edit]\nNotability[edit]\nFor what to do with a subject that does not qualify for a separate article, see WP:FAILN.\nShortcutWP:NFRINGEWP:NFRINGE\nThe notability of a fringe theory must be judged by statements from verifiable and reliable sources, not the proclamations of its adherents. Additionally, the topic must satisfy general notability guidelines: the topic must receive significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject. Due consideration should be given to the fact that reputable news sources often cover less than strictly notable topics in a lighthearted fashion, such as on April Fool's Day, as \"News of the Weird\", or during \"slow news days\" (see junk food news and silly season). Even reputable news outlets have been known to publish credulous profiles of fringe theories and their proponents, and there continue to be many completely unreliable sources masquerading as legitimate.\n\nExamples[edit]\nSufficiently notable for dedicated articles:\n\nCreation science and Intelligent design—The overwhelming majority of scientists consider this to be pseudoscience and say that it should not be taught in elementary public education. However, the very existence of this strong opinion, and vigorous discussion regarding it among groups such as scientists, scientific journals, educational institutions, political institutions, and courts of law give the idea itself more than adequate notability to have articles about it on Wikipedia.\nHolocaust denial—Claims of Holocaust deniers—that Adolf Hitler had no genocidal intent against the Jews of Europe, that no gas chambers were used for mass murder at camps such as Auschwitz, that the number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than six million—are rejected as false by an overwhelming majority of professional historians, although the Holocaust deniers themselves will still occasionally get some public notice and therefore notability.\nMoon landing conspiracy theories—Conspiracy theories which aim to show that the Moon landings were fake, while probably not held as true by very many people, have generated enough discussion in books, television programs, debunking statements from NASA, etc., that they deserve an article on Wikipedia.\nNot sufficiently notable for dedicated articles:\n\nTheories of Booth's escape—The page on John Wilkes Booth includes descriptions of conspiracy theories contending that Booth eluded his pursuers and escaped. However, they are not notable enough for a dedicated article.\nNotability versus acceptance[edit]\nJust because an idea is not accepted by most experts does not mean it should be removed from Wikipedia. The threshold for whether a topic should be included in Wikipedia as an article is generally covered by notability guidelines. The complicated relationship between the level of acceptance of an idea and its notability is explored below.\n\nReporting on the levels of acceptance[edit]\nShortcutWP:FRINGELEVELWP:FRINGELEVEL\nArticles which cover controversial, disputed, or discounted ideas in detail should document (with reliable sources) the current level of their acceptance among the relevant academic community. If proper attribution cannot be found among reliable sources of an idea's standing, it should be assumed that the idea has not received consideration or acceptance; ideas should not be portrayed as accepted unless such claims can be documented in reliable sources. However, a lack of consideration or acceptance does not necessarily imply rejection, either; ideas should not be portrayed as rejected or carry negative labels such as pseudoscience unless such claims can be documented in reliable sources.\n\nEven demonstrably incorrect assertions and fringe theories like the Face on Mars can merit inclusion in an encyclopedia—as notable ideas in the public eye.\nIdeas that have been rejected, are widely considered to be absurd or pseudoscientific, only of historical interest, or primarily the realm of science fiction, should be documented as such, using reliable sources.\nIdeas that are of borderline or minimal notability may be mentioned in Wikipedia, but should not be given undue weight. Wikipedia is not a forum for presenting new ideas, for countering any systemic bias in institutions such as academia, or for otherwise promoting ideas which have failed to merit attention elsewhere. Wikipedia is not a place to right great wrongs. Fringe theories may be excluded from articles about scientific topics when the scientific community has ignored the ideas. However, ideas should not be excluded from the encyclopedia simply because they are widely held to be wrong. By the same token, the purpose of Wikipedia is not to offer originally synthesized prose \"debunking\" notable ideas which the scientific community may consider to be absurd or unworthy. Criticisms of fringe theories should be reported on relative to the visibility, notability, and reliability of the sources that do the criticizing.\nWikipedia is also not a crystal ball: While currently accepted scientific paradigms may later be rejected, and hypotheses previously held to be controversial or incorrect sometimes become accepted by the scientific community (e.g., plate tectonics), it is not the place of Wikipedia to venture such projections. If the status of a given idea changes, then Wikipedia changes to reflect that change. Wikipedia primarily focuses on the state of knowledge today, documenting the past when appropriate (identifying it as such), and avoiding speculation about the future.\n\nPeer-reviewed sources help establish the level of acceptance[edit]\nOne important barometer for determining the notability and level of acceptance of fringe ideas related to science, history or other academic pursuits is the presence or absence of peer-reviewed research on the subject. While a lack of peer-reviewed sources does not automatically mean that the subject should be excluded from Wikipedia, there must be adequate reliable sources to allow the subject to be covered in sufficient detail without engaging in original research. Care should be taken with journals that exist mainly to promote a particular viewpoint. Journals that are not peer reviewed by the wider academic community should not be considered reliable, except to show the views of the groups represented by those journals.[9]\nPeer review is an important feature of reliable sources that discuss scientific, historical or other academic ideas, but it is not the same as acceptance by the scientific community. It is important that original hypotheses that have gone through peer review do not get presented in Wikipedia as representing scientific consensus or fact. Articles about fringe theories sourced solely from a single primary source (even when it is peer reviewed) may be excluded from Wikipedia on notability grounds. Likewise, exceptional claims in Wikipedia require high-quality reliable sources.\n\nEvaluating and describing claims[edit]\nShortcutsWP:EVALFRINGEWP:EVALFRINGEWP:DESCFWP:DESCFWP:FDESCWP:FDESC\nMany encyclopedic topics can be evaluated from a number of different perspectives, and some of these perspectives may make claims that lack verification in research, that are inherently untestable, or that are pseudoscientific. In general, Wikipedia should always give prominence to established lines of research found in reliable sources and present neutral descriptions of other claims with respect to their historical, scientific, and cultural prominence. Claims that are uncontroversial and uncontested within reliable sources should be presented as simple statements of fact—e.g. \"An electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton.\"\nClaims derived from fringe theories should be carefully attributed to an appropriate source and located within a context—e.g. \"There are extreme academic views such as those of Jacques Halbronn, suggesting at great length and with great complexity that Nostradamus's Prophecies are antedated forgeries written by later hands with a political axe to grind.\" Such claims may contain or be followed by qualifiers to maintain neutrality—e.g. \"Although Halbronn possibly knows more about the texts and associated archives than almost anybody else alive (he helped dig out and research many of them), most other specialists in the field reject this view.\"—but restraint should be used with such qualifiers to avoid giving the appearance of an overly harsh or overly critical assessment. This is particularly true within articles dedicated specifically to fringe ideas: Such articles should first describe the idea clearly and objectively, then refer the reader to more accepted ideas, and avoid excessive use of point-counterpoint style refutations. It is also best to avoid hiding all disputations in an end criticism section, but instead work for integrated, easy to read, and accurate article prose.\nNotable perspectives which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena should not be treated exclusively as scientific theory and handled on that basis. For example, the Book of Genesis itself should be primarily covered as a work of ancient literature, as part of the Hebrew or Christian Bible, or for its theological significance, rather than as a cosmological theory. Perspectives which advocate non-scientific or pseudoscientific religious claims intended to directly confront scientific discoveries should be evaluated on both a scientific and a theological basis, with acknowledgment of how the most reliable sources consider the subjects. For example, creationism and creation science should be described primarily as religious and political movements and the fact that claims from those perspectives are disputed by mainstream theologians and scientists should be directly addressed. Fringe theories that oppose reliably sourced research—denialist histories, for example—should be described clearly within their own articles, but should not be given undue weight in more general discussions of the topic.\n\nUnwarranted promotion of fringe theories[edit]\nShortcutWP:PROFRINGEWP:PROFRINGE\nProponents of fringe theories seek to use Wikipedia as a forum for promoting them. Policies discourage this: if the only statements about a fringe theory come from the inventors or promoters of that theory, then \"What Wikipedia is not\" rules come into play. Wikipedia is neither a publisher of original thought nor a soapbox for self-promotion and advertising. Attempts by inventors and adherents to artificially inflate the perceived renown of their fringe theories, such as sock puppetry in AfD discussions, are prohibited. Efforts of fringe-theory inventors to promote their theories, such as the offering of self-published material as references, are unacceptable: Wikipedia is not an advertising venue. (See also Links normally to be avoided, Conflict of interest, Autobiography guidelines.) For this reason, notability guidelines for fringe topics are stricter than general notability guidelines: the notability of a fringe theory must be judged by statements from verifiable and reliable sources, not the proclamations of its adherents.\nThe neutral point of view policy requires that all majority and significant-minority positions be included in an article. However, it also requires that they not be given undue weight. A conjecture that has not received critical review from the scientific community or that has been rejected may be included in an article about a scientific subject only if other high-quality reliable sources discuss it as an alternative position. Ideas supported only by a tiny minority may be explained in articles devoted to those ideas if they are notable.\n\nMentions in other articles[edit]\nShortcutWP:ONEWAYWP:ONEWAY\nFringe views, products, or those who promote them, may be mentioned in the text of other articles only if independent reliable sources connect the topics in a serious and prominent way. However, meeting this standard indicates only that the idea may be discussed in other articles, not that it must be discussed in a specific article. If mentioning a fringe theory in another article gives undue weight to the fringe theory, discussion of the fringe theory may be limited, or even omitted altogether. If no independent reliable sources connect a particular fringe theory to a mainstream subject, there should not even be a link through a see also section, lest the article serve as a coatrack.\nFringe theories should be discussed in context; uncontroversial ideas may need to be referred to in relation to fringe theories. Discussion of mainstream ideas should be sourced from reliable mainstream sources. Links to non-fringe articles in fringe articles can also help aid the reader in understanding and remove the threat of creating a walled garden. In contrast, many mainstream articles do not link to articles about fringe theories. This is the principle of one-way linking for fringe theories.\n\nExamples\nAstrology—There are plenty of reliable sources which describe how astronomy is not astrology, and so a decent article on the former may mention the latter.\nAutodynamics—There are no reliable sources about special relativity which also mention autodynamics, and so a decent article on special relativity should not mention autodynamics.\nNote, however, that the mainstream scientific subjects are discussed and linked to in both of the above articles about fringe subjects (the Astrology article discusses astronomy, and Autodynamics discusses special relativity).\n\nTreatment of living persons[edit]\nShortcutsWP:FRINGEBLPWP:FRINGEBLPWP:BLPFRINGEWP:BLPFRINGE\nClose attention should be paid to the treatment of those who hold fringe viewpoints, since as a rule they are the focus of controversy. All articles concerning these people must also comply with Wikipedia's policy on biographies of living persons (WP:BLP). Fringe views of those better known for other achievements or incidents should not be given undue prominence, especially when these views are incidental to their fame. However, the WP:BLP policy does not provide an excuse to remove all criticism from a biography or to obscure the nature of a person's fringe advocacy outside of their field of expertise (see WP:PROFRINGE, WP:PSCI, WP:BLP § Balance).\nThere are people who are notable enough to have articles included in Wikipedia solely on the basis of their advocacy of fringe beliefs. Notability can be determined by considering whether there are enough reliable and independent sources that discuss the person in a serious and extensive manner, taking care also to avoid the pitfalls that can appear when determining the notability of fringe theories themselves. Caution should be exercised when evaluating whether there are enough sources available to write a neutral biography that neither unduly promotes nor denigrates the subject.\n\nUseful templates[edit]\nWikipedia:Neutrality templates, in particular,\n{{Fringe theories}}\n{{POV}}—There is a current dispute about the article's neutrality.\n{{Unbalanced}}\n{{Undue-inline}}—Inline citation to tag a source which might have been given more prominence than justifiable.\nWikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles, in particular,\n{{Unreliable fringe source}}—Inline citation to tag a specific sentence that may use a fringe source inappropriately.\n{{Verify credibility}}—Inline citation for a source that may be unreliable\n{{Third-party-inline}}—Inline citation to tag a specific sentence that may use a non-independent source inappropriately.\nSee also[edit]\nWikipedia:Fringe theories/Noticeboard\nEssays[edit]\nWikipedia:Academic bias\nWikipedia:Be neutral in form\nWikipedia:Cherrypicking\nWikipedia:Coatrack\nWikipedia:Creating controversial content\nWikipedia:Fringe theories for dummies\nWikipedia:Wikipedia is a mainstream encyclopedia\nWikipedia:Scientific consensus\nWikipedia:Scientific point of view\nWikipedia:Why Wikipedia cannot claim the Earth is not flat (dealing with fringe advocates)\nWikiProjects[edit]\nWikipedia:WikiProject Alternative Views\nWikipedia:WikiProject Skepticism\nArbitration requests[edit]\nWikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience\nWikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Fringe science\nWikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Barrett v.

Substantive edits to this page should reflect consensus. When in doubt, discuss first on this guideline's talk page.ShortcutsWP:FRINGEWP:FRINGEWP:FRNGWP:FRNG\nFringe theories in a nutshell: To maintain a neutral point of view, an idea that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight in an article about a mainstream idea. More extensive treatment should be reserved for an article about the idea, which must meet the test of notability.

Because Wikipedia aims to summarize significant opinions with representation in proportion to their prominence, a Wikipedia article should not make a fringe theory appear more notable or more widely accepted than it is. Statements about the truth of a theory must be based upon independent reliable sources. If discussed in an article about a mainstream idea, a theory that is not broadly supported by scholarship in its field must not be given undue weight,[1] and reliable sources must be cited that affirm the relationship of the marginal idea to the mainstream idea in a serious and substantial manner.\nThere are numerous reasons for these requirements. Wikipedia is not and must not become the validating source for non-significant subjects, and it is not a forum for original research.[2] For writers and editors of Wikipedia articles to write about controversial ideas in a neutral manner, it is of vital importance that they simply restate what is said by independent secondary sources of reasonable reliability and quality.\nThe governing policies regarding fringe theories are the three core content policies: Neutral point of view, No original research, and Verifiability. Jointly these say that articles should not contain any novel analysis or synthesis, that material likely to be challenged needs a reliable source, and that all majority and significant-minority views published in reliable sources should be represented fairly and proportionately. Should any inconsistency arise between this guideline and the content policies, the policies take precedence.\nFringe theories and related articles have been the subject of several arbitration cases. See Wikipedia:Fringe theories/Arbitration cases.\n\n\nIdentifying fringe theories[edit]\nWe use the term fringe theory in a very broad sense to describe an idea that departs significantly from the prevailing views or mainstream views in its particular field. For example, fringe theories in science depart significantly from mainstream science and have little or no scientific support.[3] Other examples include conspiracy theories and esoteric claims about medicine. Scholarly opinion is generally the most authoritative source to identify the mainstream view. However, there are at least two caveats: not every identified subject matter has its own academic specialization, and the opinion of a scholar whose expertise is in a different field should not be given undue weight.\nWhen discussing topics that reliable sources say are pseudoscientific or fringe theories, editors should be careful not to present the pseudoscientific fringe views alongside the scientific or academic consensus as though they are opposing but still equal views. While pseudoscience may, in some cases, be significant to an article, it should not obfuscate the description or prominence of the mainstream views.\n\n\nSpectrum of fringe theories[edit]\nNot all pseudoscience and fringe theories are alike. In addition, there is an approximate demarcation between pseudoscience and questionable science, and they merit careful treatment.[4] Poorly conducted research, research fraud and other types of bad science are not necessarily pseudoscientific – refer to reliable sources to find the appropriate characterisation.\n\nPseudoscience[edit]\nShortcutWP:FRINGE/PSWP:FRINGE/PS\nProposals that, while purporting to be scientific, are obviously bogus may be so labeled and categorized as such without more justification. For example, since the universal scientific view is that perpetual motion is impossible, any purported perpetual motion mechanism (e.g. Stanley Meyer's water fuel cell) may be treated as pseudoscience. Proposals that are generally considered pseudoscience by the scientific community, such as astrology, may properly contain that information and may be categorized as pseudoscience.\n\nY Pseudoscience (Non-scientific statement claiming to be scientific): String theory proves that running water emits electricity when the quarks are aligned with the stars.\nN Not pseudoscience (no claim that it's scientific): Santa Claus has magic reindeer that can fly.\nQuestionable science[edit]\nShortcutWP:FRINGE/QSWP:FRINGE/QS\nArticles about hypotheses that have a substantial following but which critics describe as pseudoscience, may note those critics' views; however, such hypotheses should not be described as unambiguously pseudoscientific if a reasonable amount of academic debate still exists.\n\nAlternative theoretical formulations[edit]\nShortcutWP:FRINGE/ALTWP:FRINGE/ALT\nAlternative theoretical formulations from within the scientific community are not pseudoscience, but part of the scientific process. They should not be classified as pseudoscience but should still be put into context with respect to the mainstream perspective. Such theoretical formulations may fail to explain some aspect of reality, but, should they succeed in doing so, will usually be rapidly accepted. For instance, continental drift was heavily criticized because there was no known mechanism for continents to move and the proposed mechanisms were implausible. When a mechanism was discovered through plate tectonics, it became mainstream. In other cases, an alternative theoretical formulation lacks significant evidence to show its validity, but when such evidence is produced, the theory can become mainstream. Examples of this are the existence of Troy,[5][6] the Norse colonization of the Americas, and the Big Bang Theory.[7]\nTo determine whether something is pseudoscientific or merely an alternative theoretical formulation, consider this: Alternative theoretical formulations generally tweak things on the frontiers of science, or deal with strong, puzzling evidence—which is difficult to explain away—in an effort to create a model that better explains reality. Pseudoscience generally proposes changes in the basic laws of nature to allow some phenomenon which the supporters want to believe occurs, but lack the strong scientific evidence or rigour that would justify such major changes. Pseudoscience usually relies on attacking mainstream scientific theories and methodology while lacking a critical discourse itself (as is common among proponents of creation science), relies on weak evidence such as anecdotal evidence or weak statistical evidence (as for example in parapsychology), or indulges a suspect theoretical premise (such as the claims of water memory made by advocates of homeopathy).\n\nSourcing[edit]\nReliable sources[edit]\nSee also: WP:SOURCE and WP:IRS\nReliable sources are needed for any article in Wikipedia. They are needed to demonstrate that an idea is sufficiently notable to merit a dedicated article about it. For a fringe view to be discussed in an article about a mainstream idea, independent reliable sources must discuss the relationship of the two as a serious and substantial matter.\nReliable sources on Wikipedia may include peer-reviewed journals; books published by university presses; university-level textbooks; magazines, journals, and books published by respected publishing houses; and mainstream newspapers. Academic and peer-reviewed publications are usually the most reliable sources in areas where they are available, but material from reliable non-academic sources may also be used in these areas.\nSubjects receive attention in Wikipedia in proportion to the level of detail in the sources from which the article is written. For example, if the only references to a particular subject are in news sources, then a level of detail which is greater than that which appears in these news sources is inappropriate, because Wikipedia policy prohibits original research. The no original research policy strongly encourages the collection and organization of information from existing secondary sources, and allows for careful use of primary sources.\n\nIndependent sources[edit]\nShortcutsWP:FRINDWP:FRINDWP:MSSWP:MSS\nSee also: Wikipedia:Independent sources\nThe best sources to use when describing fringe theories, and in determining their notability and prominence, are reliable sources that are outside the sourcing ecosystem of the fringe theory itself, as such sources are necessary to determine the relationship of a fringe theory to mainstream scholarly discourse. In particular, the relative space that an article devotes to different aspects of a fringe theory should follow from consideration primarily of mainstream secondary sources. Points that are not discussed in these mainstream sources should not be given any space in articles. Fringe sources can be used to support text that describes fringe theories provided that such sources have been noticed and given proper context in mainstream sources.\n\nParity of sources[edit]\nShortcutWP:PARITYWP:PARITY\nInclusion and exclusion of content related to fringe theories and criticism of fringe theories may be done by means of a rough parity of sources. If an article is written about a well-known topic about which many peer-reviewed articles are written, it should not include fringe theories that may seem relevant but are only sourced to obscure texts that lack peer review. Note that fringe journals exist, some of which claim peer review. Only a few of these actually have any meaningful peer review outside of promoters of the fringe theories, and they should generally be considered unreliable. Examples of unreliable journals include but are not limited to: the Creation Research Society Quarterly, Homeopathy, and the Journal of Frontier Science (which uses blog comments[8] as its supposed peer review).\nIn an article on a fringe topic, if a notable fringe theory is primarily described by amateurs and self-published texts, verifiable and reliable criticism of the fringe theory need not be published in a peer-reviewed journal. For example, the Moon landing conspiracy theories article may include material from reliable websites, movies, television specials, and books that are not peer-reviewed. By parity of sources, critiques of that material can likewise be gleaned from reliable websites and books that are not peer-reviewed. Of course, for any viewpoint described in an article, only reliable sources should be used; Wikipedia's verifiability and biographies of living persons policies are not suspended simply because the topic is a fringe theory.\nParity of sources may mean that certain fringe theories are only reliably and verifiably reported on, or criticized, in alternative venues from those that are typically considered reliable sources for scientific topics on Wikipedia. For example, the lack of peer-reviewed criticism of creation science should not be used as a justification for marginalizing or removing scientific criticism of creation science, since creation science itself is not published in peer-reviewed journals. Likewise, the views of adherents should not be excluded from an article on creation science solely on the basis that their work lacks peer review. Other considerations for notability should be considered as well. Fringe views are properly excluded from articles on mainstream subjects to the extent that they are rarely if ever included by reliable sources on those subjects.\nThe prominence of fringe views needs to be put in perspective relative to the views of the entire encompassing field; limiting that relative perspective to a restricted subset of specialists or only among the proponents of that view is, necessarily, biased and unrepresentative.\n\nAttribution[edit]\nMain pages: Wikipedia:Verifiability and Wikipedia:No original research\nWikipedia is meant to be a tertiary source of information, summarizing the information gleaned from secondary sources, and in some cases from primary sources. Primary sources about research and investigations should only be used to verify the text and should not be relied on exclusively as doing so would violate Wikipedia's policies on original research. In the case of obscure fringe theories, secondary sources that describe the theories should be carefully vetted for reliability.\n\nQuotations[edit]\nWhile proper attribution of a perspective to a source satisfies the minimal requirements of Wikipedia's neutral point of view, there is an additional editorial responsibility for including only those quotes and perspectives which further the aim of creating a verifiable and neutral Wikipedia article. Quotes that are controversial or potentially misleading need to be properly contextualized to avoid unintentional endorsement or deprecation. What is more, just because a quote is accurate and verifiably attributed to a particular source does not mean that the quote must necessarily be included in an article. The sourced contribution must simply aid in the verifiable and neutral presentation of the subject.\nFor example, in the article about Bigfoot, a verifiably attributed and accurately preserved quotation might take the following form:\n\nThe Bigfoot Field Researchers Association has stated, \"Scientists from various disciplines put the most compelling sasquatch evidence to the test. Collectively their conclusions are ground-breaking. There is now scientific proof for the existence of a giant primate species in North America—a species fitting the descriptions of sasquatches (bigfoots).\"\nIncluding such a quote needs to be carefully contextualized as a particular point of view. Simply including such a statement in the lead or in a section on scientific evaluation of Bigfoot claims is potentially misleading, non-neutral, and lacking in verifiability. The quote should only be included if it can be contextualized in a verifiable and neutral sense as a point of view of the Bigfoot Field Researchers Association and not necessarily a factual statement. The consensus of editors may even be to not include the quote at all.\n\nIn-text attribution[edit]\nShortcutWP:ITAWP:ITA\nSee also: In-text attribution and Assert facts, not opinions\nThe careful use of sources is vital when writing about criticism of fringe theories. Since fringe theories may be obscure topics that few non-adherents write about, there may only be a small number of sources that directly dispute them. Care should be taken not to mislead the reader by implying that, because the claim is actively disputed by only a few, it is otherwise supported. Particularly harsh criticism should be attributed—\"Philosopher A. C. Grayling dismisses intelligent design as 'a little driblet of childish ignorance; a mark of mankind's infancy'\"—while simple facts—\"humans and chimpanzees evolved from a common ancestor\"—are best left stated simply as facts rather than recast as opinions. Be careful not to use in-text attribution carelessly to imply that only the named sources would agree. A careful use of words and the adoption of a disinterested tone will ensure that a reader is not spoonfed opinions as facts and vice versa.\n\nCoverage in Wikipedia[edit]\nNotability[edit]\nFor what to do with a subject that does not qualify for a separate article, see WP:FAILN.\nShortcutWP:NFRINGEWP:NFRINGE\nThe notability of a fringe theory must be judged by statements from verifiable and reliable sources, not the proclamations of its adherents. Additionally, the topic must satisfy general notability guidelines: the topic must receive significant coverage in reliable sources that are independent of the subject. Due consideration should be given to the fact that reputable news sources often cover less than strictly notable topics in a lighthearted fashion, such as on April Fool's Day, as \"News of the Weird\", or during \"slow news days\" (see junk food news and silly season). Even reputable news outlets have been known to publish credulous profiles of fringe theories and their proponents, and there continue to be many completely unreliable sources masquerading as legitimate.\n\nExamples[edit]\nSufficiently notable for dedicated articles:\n\nCreation science and Intelligent design—The overwhelming majority of scientists consider this to be pseudoscience and say that it should not be taught in elementary public education. However, the very existence of this strong opinion, and vigorous discussion regarding it among groups such as scientists, scientific journals, educational institutions, political institutions, and courts of law give the idea itself more than adequate notability to have articles about it on Wikipedia.\nHolocaust denial—Claims of Holocaust deniers—that Adolf Hitler had no genocidal intent against the Jews of Europe, that no gas chambers were used for mass murder at camps such as Auschwitz, that the number of Jews killed by the Nazis was far less than six million—are rejected as false by an overwhelming majority of professional historians, although the Holocaust deniers themselves will still occasionally get some public notice and therefore notability.\nMoon landing conspiracy theories—Conspiracy theories which aim to show that the Moon landings were fake, while probably not held as true by very many people, have generated enough discussion in books, television programs, debunking statements from NASA, etc., that they deserve an article on Wikipedia.\nNot sufficiently notable for dedicated articles:\n\nTheories of Booth's escape—The page on John Wilkes Booth includes descriptions of conspiracy theories contending that Booth eluded his pursuers and escaped. However, they are not notable enough for a dedicated article.\nNotability versus acceptance[edit]\nJust because an idea is not accepted by most experts does not mean it should be removed from Wikipedia. The threshold for whether a topic should be included in Wikipedia as an article is generally covered by notability guidelines. The complicated relationship between the level of acceptance of an idea and its notability is explored below.\n\nReporting on the levels of acceptance[edit]\nShortcutWP:FRINGELEVELWP:FRINGELEVEL\nArticles which cover controversial, disputed, or discounted ideas in detail should document (with reliable sources) the current level of their acceptance among the relevant academic community. If proper attribution cannot be found among reliable sources of an idea's standing, it should be assumed that the idea has not received consideration or acceptance; ideas should not be portrayed as accepted unless such claims can be documented in reliable sources. However, a lack of consideration or acceptance does not necessarily imply rejection, either; ideas should not be portrayed as rejected or carry negative labels such as pseudoscience unless such claims can be documented in reliable sources.\n\nEven demonstrably incorrect assertions and fringe theories like the Face on Mars can merit inclusion in an encyclopedia—as notable ideas in the public eye.\nIdeas that have been rejected, are widely considered to be absurd or pseudoscientific, only of historical interest, or primarily the realm of science fiction, should be documented as such, using reliable sources.\nIdeas that are of borderline or minimal notability may be mentioned in Wikipedia, but should not be given undue weight. Wikipedia is not a forum for presenting new ideas, for countering any systemic bias in institutions such as academia, or for otherwise promoting ideas which have failed to merit attention elsewhere. Wikipedia is not a place to right great wrongs. Fringe theories may be excluded from articles about scientific topics when the scientific community has ignored the ideas. However, ideas should not be excluded from the encyclopedia simply because they are widely held to be wrong. By the same token, the purpose of Wikipedia is not to offer originally synthesized prose \"debunking\" notable ideas which the scientific community may consider to be absurd or unworthy. Criticisms of fringe theories should be reported on relative to the visibility, notability, and reliability of the sources that do the criticizing.\nWikipedia is also not a crystal ball: While currently accepted scientific paradigms may later be rejected, and hypotheses previously held to be controversial or incorrect sometimes become accepted by the scientific community (e.g., plate tectonics), it is not the place of Wikipedia to venture such projections. If the status of a given idea changes, then Wikipedia changes to reflect that change. Wikipedia primarily focuses on the state of knowledge today, documenting the past when appropriate (identifying it as such), and avoiding speculation about the future.\n\nPeer-reviewed sources help establish the level of acceptance[edit]\nOne important barometer for determining the notability and level of acceptance of fringe ideas related to science, history or other academic pursuits is the presence or absence of peer-reviewed research on the subject. While a lack of peer-reviewed sources does not automatically mean that the subject should be excluded from Wikipedia, there must be adequate reliable sources to allow the subject to be covered in sufficient detail without engaging in original research. Care should be taken with journals that exist mainly to promote a particular viewpoint. Journals that are not peer reviewed by the wider academic community should not be considered reliable, except to show the views of the groups represented by those journals.[9]\nPeer review is an important feature of reliable sources that discuss scientific, historical or other academic ideas, but it is not the same as acceptance by the scientific community. It is important that original hypotheses that have gone through peer review do not get presented in Wikipedia as representing scientific consensus or fact. Articles about fringe theories sourced solely from a single primary source (even when it is peer reviewed) may be excluded from Wikipedia on notability grounds. Likewise, exceptional claims in Wikipedia require high-quality reliable sources.\n\nEvaluating and describing claims[edit]\nShortcutsWP:EVALFRINGEWP:EVALFRINGEWP:DESCFWP:DESCFWP:FDESCWP:FDESC\nMany encyclopedic topics can be evaluated from a number of different perspectives, and some of these perspectives may make claims that lack verification in research, that are inherently untestable, or that are pseudoscientific. In general, Wikipedia should always give prominence to established lines of research found in reliable sources and present neutral descriptions of other claims with respect to their historical, scientific, and cultural prominence. Claims that are uncontroversial and uncontested within reliable sources should be presented as simple statements of fact—e.g. \"An electron has a mass that is approximately 1/1836 that of the proton.\"\nClaims derived from fringe theories should be carefully attributed to an appropriate source and located within a context—e.g. \"There are extreme academic views such as those of Jacques Halbronn, suggesting at great length and with great complexity that Nostradamus's Prophecies are antedated forgeries written by later hands with a political axe to grind.\" Such claims may contain or be followed by qualifiers to maintain neutrality—e.g. \"Although Halbronn possibly knows more about the texts and associated archives than almost anybody else alive (he helped dig out and research many of them), most other specialists in the field reject this view.\"—but restraint should be used with such qualifiers to avoid giving the appearance of an overly harsh or overly critical assessment. This is particularly true within articles dedicated specifically to fringe ideas: Such articles should first describe the idea clearly and objectively, then refer the reader to more accepted ideas, and avoid excessive use of point-counterpoint style refutations. It is also best to avoid hiding all disputations in an end criticism section, but instead work for integrated, easy to read, and accurate article prose.\nNotable perspectives which are primarily non-scientific in nature but which contain claims concerning scientific phenomena should not be treated exclusively as scientific theory and handled on that basis. For example, the Book of Genesis itself should be primarily covered as a work of ancient literature, as part of the Hebrew or Christian Bible, or for its theological significance, rather than as a cosmological theory. Perspectives which advocate non-scientific or pseudoscientific religious claims intended to directly confront scientific discoveries should be evaluated on both a scientific and a theological basis, with acknowledgment of how the most reliable sources consider the subjects. For example, creationism and creation science should be described primarily as religious and political movements and the fact that claims from those perspectives are disputed by mainstream theologians and scientists should be directly addressed. Fringe theories that oppose reliably sourced research—denialist histories, for example—should be described clearly within their own articles, but should not be given undue weight in more general discussions of the topic.\n\nUnwarranted promotion of fringe theories[edit]\nShortcutWP:PROFRINGEWP:PROFRINGE\nProponents of fringe theories seek to use Wikipedia as a forum for promoting them. Policies discourage this: if the only statements about a fringe theory come from the inventors or promoters of that theory, then \"What Wikipedia is not\" rules come into play. Wikipedia is neither a publisher of original thought nor a soapbox for self-promotion and advertising. Attempts by inventors and adherents to artificially inflate the perceived renown of their fringe theories, such as sock puppetry in AfD discussions, are prohibited. Efforts of fringe-theory inventors to promote their theories, such as the offering of self-published material as references, are unacceptable: Wikipedia is not an advertising venue. (See also Links normally to be avoided, Conflict of interest, Autobiography guidelines.) For this reason, notability guidelines for fringe topics are stricter than general notability guidelines: the notability of a fringe theory must be judged by statements from verifiable and reliable sources, not the proclamations of its adherents.\nThe neutral point of view policy requires that all majority and significant-minority positions be included in an article. However, it also requires that they not be given undue weight. A conjecture that has not received critical review from the scientific community or that has been rejected may be included in an article about a scientific subject only if other high-quality reliable sources discuss it as an alternative position. Ideas supported only by a tiny minority may be explained in articles devoted to those ideas if they are notable.\n\nMentions in other articles[edit]\nShortcutWP:ONEWAYWP:ONEWAY\nFringe views, products, or those who promote them, may be mentioned in the text of other articles only if independent reliable sources connect the topics in a serious and prominent way. However, meeting this standard indicates only that the idea may be discussed in other articles, not that it must be discussed in a specific article. If mentioning a fringe theory in another article gives undue weight to the fringe theory, discussion of the fringe theory may be limited, or even omitted altogether. If no independent reliable sources connect a particular fringe theory to a mainstream subject, there should not even be a link through a see also section, lest the article serve as a coatrack.\nFringe theories should be discussed in context; uncontroversial ideas may need to be referred to in relation to fringe theories. Discussion of mainstream ideas should be sourced from reliable mainstream sources. Links to non-fringe articles in fringe articles can also help aid the reader in understanding and remove the threat of creating a walled garden. In contrast, many mainstream articles do not link to articles about fringe theories. This is the principle of one-way linking for fringe theories.\n\nExamples\nAstrology—There are plenty of reliable sources which describe how astronomy is not astrology, and so a decent article on the former may mention the latter.\nAutodynamics—There are no reliable sources about special relativity which also mention autodynamics, and so a decent article on special relativity should not mention autodynamics.\nNote, however, that the mainstream scientific subjects are discussed and linked to in both of the above articles about fringe subjects (the Astrology article discusses astronomy, and Autodynamics discusses special relativity).\n\nTreatment of living persons[edit]\nShortcutsWP:FRINGEBLPWP:FRINGEBLPWP:BLPFRINGEWP:BLPFRINGE\nClose attention should be paid to the treatment of those who hold fringe viewpoints, since as a rule they are the focus of controversy. All articles concerning these people must also comply with Wikipedia's policy on biographies of living persons (WP:BLP). Fringe views of those better known for other achievements or incidents should not be given undue prominence, especially when these views are incidental to their fame. However, the WP:BLP policy does not provide an excuse to remove all criticism from a biography or to obscure the nature of a person's fringe advocacy outside of their field of expertise (see WP:PROFRINGE, WP:PSCI, WP:BLP § Balance).\nThere are people who are notable enough to have articles included in Wikipedia solely on the basis of their advocacy of fringe beliefs. Notability can be determined by considering whether there are enough reliable and independent sources that discuss the person in a serious and extensive manner, taking care also to avoid the pitfalls that can appear when determining the notability of fringe theories themselves. Caution should be exercised when evaluating whether there are enough sources available to write a neutral biography that neither unduly promotes nor denigrates the subject.\n\nUseful templates[edit]\nWikipedia:Neutrality templates, in particular,\n{{Fringe theories}}\n{{POV}}—There is a current dispute about the article's neutrality.\n{{Unbalanced}}\n{{Undue-inline}}—Inline citation to tag a source which might have been given more prominence than justifiable.\nWikipedia:Template messages/Sources of articles, in particular,\n{{Unreliable fringe source}}—Inline citation to tag a specific sentence that may use a fringe source inappropriately.\n{{Verify credibility}}—Inline citation for a source that may be unreliable\n{{Third-party-inline}}—Inline citation to tag a specific sentence that may use a non-independent source inappropriately.\nSee also[edit]\nWikipedia:Fringe theories/Noticeboard\nEssays[edit]\nWikipedia:Academic bias\nWikipedia:Be neutral in form\nWikipedia:Cherrypicking\nWikipedia:Coatrack\nWikipedia:Creating controversial content\nWikipedia:Fringe theories for dummies\nWikipedia:Wikipedia is a mainstream encyclopedia\nWikipedia:Scientific consensus\nWikipedia:Scientific point of view\nWikipedia:Why Wikipedia cannot claim the Earth is not flat (dealing with fringe advocates)\nWikiProjects[edit]\nWikipedia:WikiProject Alternative Views\nWikipedia:WikiProject Skepticism\nArbitration requests[edit]\nWikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Pseudoscience\nWikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Fringe science\nWikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Barrett v.
