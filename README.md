## Description

In a recent article in the _New Yorker_, Princeton professor D. Graham Burnett observes, "But to
be human is not to have answers. It is to have _questions_—and to live with them. The machines
can’t do that for us. Not now, not ever" ("Will the Humanities Survive Artificial Intelligence?",
April 26, 2025). For us to grapple with what "the machines" mean to us---or, in bleaker terms, what
business-types want artificial intelligence (AI) to mean for their bottom lines---we must first
understand the limits of what the machines can do.

This course explores the so-called "digital humanities" with a view towards the role of
computational methods, including AI, in the humanistic disciplines. This exploration will entail
learning to view textual and material objects of study from new angles, but it also involves
learning how to scrutinize each angle of interpretation.

Beginning with workshops on textual encoding, students will gain exposure to diverse disciplines
at the intersection of data science and the humanities, from Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
to Natural Language Processing (NLP), generative art and music, and network analysis.

Students will gain familiarity with the Python programming language, as well as tools like
Voyant, TEI XML, ArcGIS, and Gephi. Through readings ranging from antiquity to the present,
students will learn about the history of the digital humanities and engage in code criticism.

Assessments include weekly quizzes or discussion posts, collaborative projects, and a final
cumulative project of each student's design.

## Grading

- 1/3 In-class participation
- 1/3 Labs and midterm projects
- 1/3 Final project

### 30% in-class participation and translation

Please come to class prepared to translate the assigned reading. It is acceptable
(and expected) to bring a "crib sheet," i.e., a notebook with translations of
words and phrases written out. Try not to write out the entire translation, and
definitely don't copy directly from another translation.

We'll review translation strategies in the first few sessions.

Keep in mind that the order in which you will have to translate will change from
class to class, so make sure to do _all_ of the reading.

In addition to translation, you might be expected to answer questions about syntax
and grammar.


### 15% each: Midterms

Each midterm will consist of two or three passages that we have translated together
in class, as well as one "unseen" passage for sight-translation.

Translations will be graded on lexical and grammatical accuracy. I'm less worried
about your English, but please try to keep your translations legible.


### 20% Final paper

Towards the end of the semester, you'll each write a 5–7-page paper on a topic of
your choosing. (I will provide some suggestions.) We'll decide on precise grading
criteria as a class, but in general you should expect to demonstrate your ability
to read and accurately interpret Homer in the original Greek, making use of
secondary literature as appropriate.

I will provide a detailed rubric along with example prompts.


### 20% Digital commentary

We will be writing a collaborative digital commentary together as a class, and
each of you will be responsible for contributing several glossae.

The goal is partly to give you another opportunity to review the material and
partly to provide an opportunity for you to work with digital methods and
technologies. We'll start by discussing how to use a digital treebank, and
we will also explore ways to use large language models (LLMs) and other
"Generative AI" tools to aid in your explication of key passages of the text.


## Statement on AI

(Adapted from ["Artificial Intelligence"](https://provost.tufts.edu/celt/online-resources/artificial-intelligence/ai-syllabus-statements/) by the Tufts' Center for the Enhancement of Learning and Teaching)

This course discourages the use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)
for translation assignments. At the same time, the course also provides
opportunities to explore the use of GAI in supplementing or augmenting our
abilities to engage with and understand Homeric song.

To this end, we will adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **NEVER** submit AI-generated work as your own. To do so is considered a violation of Tufts' [Academic Integrity Policy] (https://students.tufts.edu/community-standards/academic-integrity/academic-integrity-overview).
2. Familiarize yourself with the limitations of GAI tools. These tools all come with inherent biases, and they all make mistakes. Be aware that no matter how "confident" the AI seems, it does not actually "know" anything.
3. Cite all uses of AI. See suggestions from the [Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/Documentation/faq0422.html) and the [MLA](https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai/).
4. In addition to citation, please identify _how_ the GAI contributed to your work. (Your explanation need not be more than a sentence or two.)
5. If have any questions, please contact me by email, during office hours, or in class.

## Policies

### Attendance

Emergencies arise. Everyone is permitted one unexcused absence. If you will need to miss additional classes, please let me know as soon as possible. Unexcused absences will count as a 0 for that day's translation grade.

### Computer use

Please only use your computer (or tablet or phone) during designated times in class. Importantly, please **do not** use your computer when translating.

### Food and drink

Please eat only during breaks. (We'll have one about halfway through each class.)

Otherwise, please stay hydrated.


### Sharing

This course is designed for everyone to feel comfortable participating in discussion, asking questions, learning, and facilitating the learning of others.  In order for that atmosphere to be maintained, the recordings of our conversations will only be shared with the enrolled students in the class (not posted publicly) and it is prohibited for any of us who have access to the video to share it outside the course. Similarly, I have specifically designed the exams, handouts, and lectures for the people who are enrolled in the course this term and those may not be shared outside this course.

## Resources

### Religious accommodations

Tufts University faculty, staff, and administration highly value and acknowledge the religious diversity of its student body. Students seeking religious accommodations related to their holy days are encouraged to collaborate with faculty to make arrangements during the first week of each semester. Consult the [Multifaith Calendar](https://chaplaincy.tufts.edu/multifaith-calendar/) for upcoming holidays, links to the University Religious Accommodations Policy, and members of the University Chaplaincy who are available to respond to questions on religious observances.

### Accommodations for students with disabilities

Tufts is committed to providing equal access and support to all qualified students through the provision of reasonable accommodations. If you have a disability that requires reasonable accommodations, contact the StAAR Center at StaarCenter@tufts.edu or 617-627-4539. Please be aware that accommodations cannot be enacted retroactively, making timeliness a critical aspect for their provision.

### Academic support at the StAAR Center

The StAAR Center offers a variety of FREE resources to all students. Students may make an appointment to work on any writing-related project or assignment, attend subject tutoring in a variety of disciplines, or meet with an academic coach to hone skills like time management and navigating procrastination. Students can make an appointment for any of these services by visiting https://students.tufts.edu/staar-center.

### Student support, including mental health

As a student, there may be times when personal stressors or difficulties interfere with your academic performance or well-being. The Dean of Student Affairs Office offers support and care to undergraduates and graduate students who are experiencing difficulties, and can also aid faculty in their work with students. In addition, through Tufts’ Counseling and Mental Health Service (CMHS) students can access mental health support 24/7, and they can provide information on additional resources. CMHS also provides confidential consultation, brief counseling, and urgent care at no cost for all Tufts undergraduates as well as for graduate students who have paid the student health fee. To make an appointment, call 617-627-3360. Please visit the CMHS website: http://go.tufts.edu/Counseling to learn more about their services and resources.
