# Voyant Lab

**Again, do not use generative AI for this assignment.**

For this lab, you will compare Herodotus with Thucydides (in translation).
The goal is not to uncover anything particularly new—that would be great,
but it's not expected!—but rather to explore what we can find out about
these two authors when we read them at some remove—distantly, if you will—
with Voyant.

The analysis that you conduct can be fairly open-ended. You might, for example,
compare each of Thucydides' and Herodotus' histories to other writings from
fifth-century Athens (translations of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides should
be readily available to add to your corpus).

Your submission will take the form of a short (about 1000-word) paper, describing

1. The process and criteria that you used to assemble a corpus
2. The tools in Voyant that you used to analyze the corpus, and why
3. A critical discussion of what your data reveals about the differences and similarities
between Herodotus and Thucydides.

Note that, although the emphasis here is on distant reading, you might have to read a bit
of the authors in your corpus!

You should include no fewer than three figures from your analysis in Voyant—be sure to add
descriptive captions and to explain their relevance to your overarching research question.

This assignment is due by 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, September 30.
