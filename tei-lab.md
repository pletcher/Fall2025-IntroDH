# TEI Lab

**YOU MAY NOT USE GENERATIVE AI FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.**

In this lab, you will produce a digital edition of the text that you chose from Special Collections.

Be sure to photograph a few pages -- it's okay if you don't have time to
transcribe them all. 

Write a short (2â€“3-page) reflection on the process of transcribing to TEI. Some questions to get you started:

- What is the name of your text? Who is the author? What are some of its important features?
- In what ways is TEI helpful? Did you find that it got in the way?
- What editorial decisions need to be made when transcribing a print edition versus a manuscript?
- Could/should/would you transcribe both manuscript and print edition in the same TEI document?
Why or why not?

Use the TEI Guidelines and examples to help!

Your transcriptions and reflections are due by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on **Tuesday, September 16.**
