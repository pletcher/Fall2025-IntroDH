# TEI Lab

**YOU MAY NOT USE GENERATIVE AI FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT.**

In this lab, you will produce a digital edition of Percy Shelley's translation of
Plato's _Ion_. You can access a facsimile edition here: https://archive.org/details/essayslettersfro01shelrich/page/272/mode/2up

As you transcribe the text, consider what elements of this printing you need
to preserve. What are you trying to communicate to potential readers? How
does your edition differ from the facsimile?

When you have finished, compare both the facsimile edition and your transcription
to Shelley's earlier draft: http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/contents/ion/

(You can access a transcription and the TEI for that transcription by clicking
on any of the individual page images.)

Write a short (2â€“3-page) reflection on this comparison. Some questions to get you started:

- How did Shelley's translation evolve over time? How did the TEI editors
communicate that evolution to the reader?
- What editorial decisions need to be made when transcribing a print edition versus a manuscript?
- Could/should/would you transcribe both manuscript and print edition in the same TEI document?
Why or why not?

Your transcriptions and reflections are due by 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time
on **Tuesday, September 16.**
