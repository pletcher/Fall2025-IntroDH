# NLP Lab

This lab can build on your web scraping work, or you can
find another corpus of texts to work with.

Your task is to use spaCy, BookNLP, and/or any other relevant
resources to analyze the data that you scraped and/or collected.

This lab is deliberately open-ended: the goal is for you to
try a few different experiments and to see if you can find
anything interesting about your data.

As always, the questions below are just meant to get you started---they are not
exhaustive (please go beyond them!), and you don't have to answer all or any of them.

Do some kinds of articles or books contain more or less of certain kinds of events?

What kinds of named entities predominate, and does the appearance of a certain
kind of entity predict more of the same or different entities elsewhere in
the document?

Do certain kinds of networks emerge, either among "characters" (or characters,
if you're using books) or among concepts?

Is your corpus amenable to accurate topic modeling? What topics emerge?
