# Lab Rubric

## The A Range

A lab in the A range is mostly free from grammar and spelling mistakes.
It is structured in a logical and easy-to-follow format, using visual
aids where appropriate.
It not only addresses the problems and questions established in the lab's
instructions, but it also offers new questions or avenues of inquiry and
makes an attempt to answer them. Most importantly, an A-range lab reflects
on the process of inquiry and/or the methodology that was deployed to
complete the lab.

## The B Range

A B-range lab might have occasional grammar and spelling mistakes, but
it remains easy to understand. It rises the challenge of the questions
posed by the lab's instructions, but it fails to reflect meaningfully
on the methodology or scientific process. It might also come up short
in its attempts to identify new questions or avenues of inquiry, or
it might not establish a strong connection between its proposed
follow-up questions and the actual work that was completed.

## The C Range

A lab in the C range is occasionally difficult to read due to
grammar and/or spelling mistakes. It struggles with the basic
tasks in the lab's instructions, and it makes little or no
attempt to identify meaningful follow-up questions or to reflect
on the methods and process that led to its results. The results
might be incomplete or incompletely explained. In general,
while the lab can be said to have been "completed" in a basic
sense, the submission also shows evidence of a lack of effort.


## The D and F Range

Labs in this range fail to meet the most basic criteria for
submission.
